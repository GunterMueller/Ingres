In order to create a business unit you must be authorized by the Web Deployment Option security administrator. Once you have
been authorized you will be able to declare your own business unit through the business unit module of the
Web Deployment Option Administration Tool.<p>

An example of the business unit module is seen below. For more information on creating business units, please see the 
Web Deployment Option Users Guide.<P>
