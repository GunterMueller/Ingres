E_AD0002_INCOMPLETE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This is an expected message.  However, if this message appears in a
	log file, then something is wrong.

 System Status:
	All is normal.

 Recommendation:
	Call Ingres Corporation Technical Support if this message appears. 
	It is an expected event internally; however, it should never appear

E_AD0125_MNYDIV_WARN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_AD0126_DECDIV_WARN:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
	%0d - number of attempted divisions-by-zero detected

 Explanation:
	The operations ADF was asked to perform resulted in a division where
	the divisor was a packed decimal number with a zero value.  ADF was
	set to generate warnings for all arithmetic exceptions, so no error
	was generated.

 System Status:
	This is a warning message.  The results of all attempted divisions
	with a zero divisor were set to zero.

 Recommendation:
	None required.  Alternative handling for arithmetic exceptions is
	available and fully explained in the documentation set.

	If these warnings were unexpected, they may be occurring because a
	small value was truncated to zero while being coerced or converted
	to a packed decimal number with insufficient scale to hold this small
	number.  Using the decimal() conversion function to convert the
	intermediate result to a value with more scale digits might help.


E_AD0127_DECOVF_WARN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - number of overflows detected

 Explanation:
	The operations ADF was asked to perform resulted in a packed decimal
	expression or sub-expression whose result exceeded the number of
	integral digits available in the result value.  Packed decimal result
	precision and scale are calculated according to the formulas shown
	in the documentation.  If an intermediate result has more
	significant integral (i.e., to the left of the decimal point) digits
	than were available in the result, overflow will occur.  Another
	possibility is that an attempt was made to coerce or convert a number
	with more significant integral digits to a packed decimal number
	which did not have space for these integral digits.  This could occur
	when assigning a value to a column in a table, or when using the
	decimal() conversion function.

	An example of overflow is easy to construct: decimal(123.1, 4, 2) will
	cause packed decimal overflow, because the number of significant
	integral digits in the number being converted exceeds the number
	allowed for in the result.  (123.1 has 3 significant non-zero digits,
	the resulting packed decimal number will have space for 4-2=2 integral
	digits, which is insufficient.)

	ADF was set to generate warnings for all arithmetic exceptions, so no
	error was generated.

 System Status:
	This is a warning message.  The results of all overflowed expressions
	were set to zero.

 Recommendation:
	None required.  Alternative handling for arithmetic exceptions is
	available and fully explained in the documentation set.

	If these warnings were unexpected, try simplifying the expression which
	is generating this overflow until you can reproduce the problem with as
	few variables, column names, arithmetic operators, etc. as possible.
	Then, using the formulas given in the documentation, calculate
	the result size for your simplified expression.  It should become clear
	why the expression is overflowing.  Once you determine why the overflow
	is occurring, you may want to use the decimal() conversion function to
	change the precision and scale of your intermediate result, or if the
	result is very large, you may want to convert to a floating point
	datatype using the float4() or float8() conversion function.

 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
 	The secure operating system rejected an existing internal security
	label as invalid. This could be caused by either a corrupted 
	security label, or by the secure operating system being changed 
	such that the label is no longer known; for example, the OS label 
	mapping file (if applicable) may have been changed in an 
	incompatible way.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the label/and or secure operating system configuration.


E_AD1096_SESSION_PRIV:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR

E_AD1125_MNYDIV_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_AD1126_DECDIV_ERROR:SS22012_DIVISION_BY_ZERO


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The operation ADF was asked to perform resulted in a division where
	the divisor was a packed decimal number with a zero value.  ADF was
	set to generate errors for all arithmetic exceptions, so the query
	was immediately aborted.

 System Status:
	The query was aborted.

 Recommendation:
	If this error was unexpected, it may be occurring because a
	small value was truncated to zero while being coerced or converted
	to a packed decimal number with insufficient scale to hold this small
	number.  Using the decimal() conversion function to convert the
	intermediate result to a value with more scale digits might help.

	Alternative handling for arithmetic exceptions is available and fully
	explained in the documentation set.


E_AD1127_DECOVF_ERROR:SS22003_NUM_VAL_OUT_OF_RANGE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The operation ADF was asked to perform resulted in a packed decimal
	expression or sub-expression whose result exceeded the number of
	integral digits available in the result value.  Packed decimal result
	precision and scale are calculated according to the formulas shown
	in the documentation.  If an intermediate result has more
	significant integral (i.e., to the left of the decimal point) digits
	than were available in the result, overflow will occur.  Another
	possibility is that an attempt was made to coerce or convert a number
	with more significant integral digits to a packed decimal number
	which did not have space for these integral digits.  This could occur
	when assigning a value to a column in a table, or when using the

	An example of overflow is easy to construct: decimal(123.1, 4, 2) will
	cause packed decimal overflow because the number of significant
	integral digits in the number being converted exceeds the number
	allowed for in the result.  (123.1 has 3 significant non-zero digits,
	the resulting packed decimal number will have space for 4-2=2 integral
	digits, which is insufficient.)

	ADF was set to generate errors for all arithmetic exceptions, so this
	query will be aborted.

 System Status:
	The query was aborted.

 Recommendation:

E_AD2050_NO_COMVEC_FUNC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_AD2060_BAD_DT_COUNT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Currently, functions are limited to 0, 1, or 2, parameters.
	This error indicates that some facility called ADF with a number of
	input datatypes that was none of these.

 System Status:
	This is an internal error.  The current query will most likely be
	aborted.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_AD2061_BAD_OP_COUNT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Some facility called ADF for datatype resolution, but none of ADF's
	function instance entries matched the requested operation ID or had the
	specified number of input datatypes.

 System Status:
	The current query will most likely be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure that the function you are using accepts the number of inputs you
	are attempting to pass to it.


E_AD2062_NO_FUNC_FOUND:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This operation is known to ADF, but the datatype(s) given to ADF is not
	coercible to the type required to use any of the entries in ADF's
	function instance table.

 System Status:
	The current query will most likely be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Refer to the documentation for information on which datatypes
	can be used for this operation.


E_AD2063_FUNC_AMBIGUOUS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	ADF's datatype resolution rules have been unable to decide on a function
	instance from its internal tables.  After using several tie-breaking
	strategies, several equally suitable candidate function instances
	remained.

 System Status:
	The current query will most likely be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Explicitly convert your parameters to the input types desired.


E_AD2070_NO_EMBED_ALLOWED:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A column specification with an embedded number was detected where it
	is not allowed.  For example, specifying "char10" will generate this
	error, because you must use parentheses when specifying the length for
	the "char" datatype.  Specifying a length for the "date" datatype
	(e.g., "date(10)") will also generate this error, because you are not
	allowed to specify a length for the "date" datatype.

 System Status:
	The current action will most likely be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Use the correct syntax when specifying columns with this datatype.


E_AD2071_NO_PAREN_ALLOWED:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A column specification with parenthesized numbers following the
	datatype name was detected where it is not allowed.  For example,
	specifying "c(10)" will generate this error because you must not use
	parentheses when specifying the length for the "c" datatype. Specifying
	a length for the "date" datatype (e.g., "date(10)") will also generate
	this error because you are not allowed to specify a length for the
	"date" datatype.

 System Status:
	The current action will most likely be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Use the correct syntax when specifying columns with this datatype.


E_AD2072_NO_PAREN_AND_EMBED:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A column specification with an embedded number and parenthesized
	numbers was given.  For example, specifying "char10(10)" will
	generate this error.  You are allowed to specify the length for
	a datatype in only one way.

 System Status:
	The current action will most likely be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Use the correct syntax when specifying columns with this datatype.


E_AD2073_BAD_USER_PREC:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	%0d - precision specified for this column

 Explanation:
	The precision specified for a column with the "decimal" datatype is
	invalid.  For example, attempting to create a table with a column
	specified as "decimal(99)" will generate this error, since the
	maximum precision supported for the "decimal" datatype is 31.

 System Status:
	The current action will most likely be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Specify a precision in the proper range.


E_AD2074_BAD_USER_SCALE:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	%0d - scale specified for this column
	%1d - precision specified for this column

 Explanation:
	The scale specified for a column with the "decimal" datatype is
	invalid.  For example, attempting to create a table with a column
	specified as "decimal(10,11)" will generate this error, since the scale
	(the second number in the parentheses) must not be larger than the
	precision (the first number in the parentheses).  The scale must always
	be in the range 0 <= scale <= precision.

 System Status:
	The current action will most likely be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Specify a scale in the proper range.


E_AD2080_IFTRUE_NEEDS_INT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error cannot be incurred directly as a result of a user's query
	using the ii_iftrue() function; use of a non-integral first parameter
	by the user would have been caught by the datatype resolution algorithm.

	Instead, this is an internal problem probably caused by OPF, most
	likely as a result of an outer join in some query.

 System Status:
	The current query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your system manager.


E_AD2085_LOCATE_NEEDS_STR:SS22011_SUBSTRING_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The locate() function takes two arguments, both of which must have
	a string datatype (a string datatype is one of: C, TEXT, CHAR, or
	VARCHAR).  An invalid datatype was given.

 System Status:
	The current query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Explicitly convert any non-string datatypes to string datatypes.  For
	example, if you are trying to find the first occurrence of "x" in the
	string "32123", where "x" is an integer column, you cannot use
	"locate('32123', x)", because the second parameter is an non-string
	type.  Instead, use: locate('32123', varchar(x)).


E_AD2090_BAD_DT_FOR_STRFUNC:SS22011_SUBSTRING_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error can be incurred when a string function (i.e., c(),

E_AD5063_BAD_SYSTIME:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A conversion from a datatype to either a "table_key" or an
	"object_key" was either explicitly (i.e., table_key() or object_key()
	functions) or implicitly (conversion attempted automatically by the
	DBMS) attempted.  This conversion only works if the lengths of the
	datatype are the same.  The length of the "table_key" datatype is 8
	bytes; the length of the "object_key" datatype is 16 bytes.  The
	conversion attempted failed because the length of the source
	datatype and the length of the destination datatype were different.

 Explanation:
	
	A session encountered an error while calling the system
	dependent interface to open a directory.   This call is
	used to check the existence of a directory and to list
	contents of the directory.  Usual errors are that the given
	directory does not exist, or that for some reason permissions
	on the directory or the path to the directory deny access for
	the program attempting to access the directory.

 System Status:
	All queries encountering this error will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Check that directory exists and that permissions on the directory
	and components of the directory seem reasonable.


E_CL0618_DI_OPENDIR_FAILED:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The server was attempting to fork slave processes to perform I/O
	processing, but failed. The failure may have been due to system resource
	shortage, or to a configuration problem. Verify that the system
	has sufficient resources (swap space, process slots, semaphores, etc.)
	to fork the slave processes. Check the shared memory, using
	csreport. Check II_NUM_SLAVES to see how many slaves were being forked.

 System Status:
	The server will fail to start.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the configuration problem or resource shortage and restart the
	server.

E_CL0F27_LG_ERROR_INITIATING_IO:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


E_CL0F28_LG_WRONG_VERSION:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	When the Recovery Process (dmfrcp) is first started, it opens
	the log file and performs any recovery actions needed.

	The first step in this process is to verify that the log file
	has been initialized by the current version of the DBMS software.

	A version number is recorded in the log file header; this version
	number must match the version number compiled into the dmfrcp process.
	If the version numbers do not match, the dmfrcp process refuses to
	start.

 System Status:
	The installation cannot be started until this error is resolved.

 Recommendation:
	This error is most likely caused by an incomplete upgrade of the DBMS
	software to a new version. Occasionally, upgrading the DBMS software
	requires that the log file be re-initialized. This process is
	described in detail in the Release Notes, but basically involves
	the following steps:

	    1) Shutdown the installation normally, after first allowing
	        all recovery to complete (use "rcpconfig -shutdown",
	        not "rcpconfig -imm_shutdown").
	    2) Install the new version of the DBMS software.
	    3) Re-initialize the log file with the new DBMS software
	        by running "rcpconfig -init".
	    4) Restart the installation.

	If this error was caused by omitting step (3) above, you should
	attempt to run "rcpconfig -init", then restart the installation.

	If "rcpconfig -init" indicates that there are still active transactions
	in the log file, you must restore the previous version of the DBMS
	software and restart the installation using the previous version
	of the software; then restart the upgrade process from step (1) above.

E_CL0F2F_LG_NO_TRANSACTION:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


E_CL0F30_LG_NO_MASTER:SS50004_SYS_CONFIG_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Each installation contains a single process designated to be the
	"master" of the logging and locking operations of that installation.
	The dmfrcp process is the usual master process.  If this process
	exits abnormally without running certain cleanup routines, it may
	be possible for other processes to connect to the data structures
	left about in shared memory, and get into a state where they wait
	forever from a response from the non-existent "master" process.

	A check for the existence of the "master" is performed whenever a
	process connects to the logging system.  If the "master" process
	does not exist then this error is returned.

	This error indicates that the dmfrcp process has exited abnormally
	(causes include "kill -9" and system coding errors).  A server cannot
	be allowed to start when this condition exists, so this error is
	returned.

  System Status:
	The process being started (the dmfacp or DBMS server) fails to
	come up, printing error messages to the error log and possibly,
	in the case of the dmfacp process, to the ACP log file.

  Recommendation:
	1. Check to see if a dmfrcp process is running in the installation.
	   If one exists, this error may have been caused by a race condition
	   between starting the process and starting the dmfrcp process.
	   Try starting the server once more.
	2. If 1 is not true, then:
	   NOTE: The following should only be done by a System Administrator.
	     a. Shut down the installation using "rcpconfig imm_shutdown".
	     b. If any other processes remain active in the installation
	        following this shutdown, then shut down these processes
	        manually with the appropriate operating system command.
	     c. Restart the installation from scratch using the appropriate
	        startup command documented in the Installation
	        Guide.


E_CL0F31_LG_CANT_OPEN:SS08004_CONNECTION_REJECTED


 Parameters:
	%0 - name of the recovery log file which the system attempted to open
	%1 - Unix flag mask passed to the open() system call

 Explanation:
	All transaction recovery information is written to a single log
	file. The system's attempt to open this file has failed.

  System Status:
	The process being started halts with a fatal error.

  Recommendation:
	1) Check the file permissions on the recovery log file.
	   This file should be owned by the same user who owns the rest
	   of the installation.  The path to the file should be accessible 
	   by the DBMS System Administrator.  The file must be readable 
	   and writable by the DBMS System Administrator.

	   Make sure that the environment variable II_LOG_FILE is not
	   set in your local environment.

	2) Check permissions on executables being run.  All executables
	   which must access the recovery log file must have the "setuid"
	   bit on and be owned by the DBMS System Administrator.  These 
	   executables include: dmfacp, dmfrcp, dmfjsp, iidbms, csinstall, 
	   and others.



E_CL0F32_LG_SEM_OWNER_DEAD:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An owner of a logging critical (LK) semaphore has exited.
	The requesting process would "wait" forever for access to
	this resource if this error were not returned (possibly
	spinning, using all available CPU on the machine).

 System Status:
	All processes encountering this error will shut down.

 Recommendation:
	If any process associated with an installation does not come down,
	the installation should be shut down by hand, and then restarted
	(refer to the I&O guide for OS-specific information on how to do this).
	Information in the error log may point to the cause of the semaphore
	failure.

E_CL1226_ME_SHARED_ALLOC_FAILURE:SS50003_EXHAUSTED_RESOURCE


 Parameters:
	%0 - amount of shared memory requested (in bytes)

 Explanation:
	Shared memory has been requested using the SystemV shmget() interface.
	This routine has returned EINVAL, which can mean one of 2 things
	(use "man shmget" for information specific to your OS):

	    -  size is less than the system-imposed minimum or greater
	       than the system imposed maximum.

	    -  a shared memory identifier exists for key, but the size
	       of the segment associated with it is less than size and
	       size is not equal to zero.

	The maximum size shared-memory segment a system can provide is site-
	specific and is given by the system administrator-defined value assigned
	to SHMSIZE (in 1k units).  This value usually is defaulted to 1024,
	which sets an upper limit of 1 megabyte for a single shared memory
	buffer.  This means that under a system configured with the defaults,
	one may not start up a DBMS server using a shared buffer cache bigger
	than 512 pages:

	        512 pages * 2048 bytes/page = 1meg.

	The value of SHMSIZE should be set to at least twice the number of
	pages that you want to start up a DBMS server with. For instance,
	if you want to start up a DBMS server with a 1024-page cache,
	you should rebuild the kernel with SHMSIZE set to 2048 (actually, you
	should set it slightly higher, since there is some amount of overhead
	used by the DMF cache.)

	This example assumes a 2048 byte page.

 System Status:
	Server will not start up.

 Recommendation:
	Either restart the server with the dmf.cache_size set to less than
	1/2 the current value of SHMSIZE, or rebuild the kernel with SHMSIZE
	increased enough to support the required size buffer cache.


E_CL1227_ME_NO_SHMEM_LOCK:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A request has been made to lock memory with a server configuration
	in which mmap() is either not supported or not configured.

 System Status:
	The server will not start up.

 Recommendation:
	Reconfigure the server to not request memory locking.  (If the
	platform does indeed support mmap(), mlock() and seteuid()
	and this error is obtained, Ingres Corporation may add this 
	functionality to this platform in a future release.)


E_CL1228_ME_NO_MLOCK:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation
	The caller has requested locking memory on a system that does
	not support either the mlock() or seteuid() function;  mlock()
	is required to lock memory, seteuid() to set and reset executable
	user IDs before and after memory locking.

 System Status:
	Server will not start up.

 Recommendation:
	Reconfigure the server to not request memory locking.
	(If the platform does indeed support mmap(), mlock() and seteuid()
	and this message is obtained, Ingres Corporation may add this 
	functionality to this platform in a future release.)


E_CL1229_ME_LOCK_FAIL:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The UNIX server has failed in the attempt to lock memory.
	Other messages in the error log should identify the specific
	function error code.

	Possible problems include:
	  - server not started by root
	  - server executable not setuid root
	  - not enough memory to satisfy the lock request

 System Status:
	Server will not start up.

 Recommendation:
	Either fix the specific problem or reconfigure the server and
	remove the memory lock request.


E_CL122A_ME_LCKPAG_FAIL:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The VMS server cannot lock a shared data segment because of
	a failure of the SYS$LCKPAG system service call.  Possible
	problems include the server not running with PSWAPM privilege,
	or not enough memory either on the machine or in the server
	working set (/MAXIMUM_WORKING_SET server startup parameter).
	The specific VMS error should be available in the error log
	file.

 System Status:
	The server will not start up.

 Recommendation:
	Either fix the problem noted by the error message and retry the
	request, or remove the memory lock request from the server
	configuration.

E_CL2300_NT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_CL2401_JF_BAD_FILE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An internal error was detected by the subroutines which manage journal
	files. A journal file handle (the JFIO control block) was invalid. This
	can be caused by a program error or a memory corruption error.

 System Status:
	The journal file operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	This error message indicates a software problem. If the problem
	can be reproduced, it should be reported to Ingres Corporation 
	Technical Support as a bug.


E_CL2402_JF_END_FILE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is used internally to indicate that the end of a journal
	file has been reached -- i.e., the journal file has been completely
	read. Under normal circumstances, this message should never be reported
	to a user.

 Recommendation:
	Appearance of this message in the system error log or in the ACP
	log probably indicates a software problem. If the problem
	can be reproduced, it should be reported to Ingres Corporation 
	Technical Support as a bug.


E_CL2403_JF_BAD_OPEN:SS08004_CONNECTION_REJECTED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The operating system rejected an attempt to open a journal file. The
	specific operating system error message is appended to this error
	message, if it is available. The problem may be due to file security
	violations, to a disk error, or the journal file may have been
	accidentally erased.

 System Status:
	The journal file operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Analyze the specific operating system error message for information
	about why the journal file could not be opened. Take the appropriate
	actions to allow the DBMS to open the journal file (alter the file
	security appropriately, repair the broken disk, etc.).


E_CL2404_JF_BAD_CLOSE:SS08004_CONNECTION_REJECTED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The operating system rejected an attempt to close a journal file. The
	specific operating system error message is appended to this error
	message, if it is available. The problem may be due to a disk error.

	appropriate actions to allow the DBMS to access the journal file (add
	more disk space, alter the file security appropriately, repair the
	broken disk, etc.).


E_CL2408_JF_BAD_UPDATE:SS08004_CONNECTION_REJECTED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The operating system rejected an attempt to write the header block of a
	journal file. The specific operating system error message is appended
	to this error message, if it is available. The problem may be due to a
	disk error, or it may be a file security error, or it may be due to
	some other cause.

 System Status:
	The journal file operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Analyze the specific operating system error message for information

	etc.).


E_CL2409_JF_BAD_CREATE:SS08004_CONNECTION_REJECTED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The operating system rejected an attempt to create a journal file.
	The specific operating system error message is appended to this
	error message, if it is available. The problem is often due to
	insufficient disk space, or it may be due to a disk error or file
	security problem.

 System Status:
	The journal file operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Analyze the specific operating system error message for information
	about why the journal file could not be created. Take the
	appropriate actions to allow the DBMS to access the journal file (add
	more disk space, alter the file security appropriately, repair the
	broken disk, etc.).


E_CL240A_JF_BAD_PARAM:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An internal error was detected by the subroutines which manage journal
	files. An invalid parameter was passed to a journal file subroutine.
	This can be caused by a program error or a memory corruption error.

 System Status:
	The journal file operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	This error message indicates a software problem. If the problem
	can be reproduced, it should be reported to Ingres Corporation
	Technical Support as a bug.


E_CL240B_JF_NOT_FOUND:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A journal file was missing from the journal directory where the
	the DBMS expected to find it. This message is followed in 
	the error log by additional messages which specify which 
	journal file was missing, and where it should have been located.

	The most common reason for this error is that a journal file was
	accidentally deleted.

 System Status:
	Depending on the reason that the DBMS was trying to locate the journal
	file, the system status will vary. If the DBMS was trying to locate the
	journal file in order to add more records to it or to read records
	from it, then processing stops until the journal file can be restored
	from an operating system backup.

	If the DBMS was simply attempting to delete the journal file, then
	processing will continue (it is not considered a fatal error that the
	journal file was missing, since the DBMS was planning to delete it
	anyway).

 Recommendation:
	If the journal file must be read or written, restore the journal file
	from the appropriate operating system backup and retry the operation.

	If the journal file was about to be deleted anyway, this message
	is simply informational and no additional action is required.


E_CL240C_JF_BAD_DELETE:SS08004_CONNECTION_REJECTED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The operating system rejected a request from the DBMS to delete this
	journal file. The specific operating system error message is appended
	to this error message, if it is available. The problem is often due to
	a disk error or file security problem.

 System Status:
	If possible, the DBMS processing will continue. The journal file which
	could not be deleted is left in the journal directory. No subsequent
	access to this journal file will be needed.

 Recommendation:
	If the journal file must be read or written, restore the journal file
	from the appropriate operating system backup and retry the operation.

	If the journal file was about to be deleted anyway, this message
	is simply informational and no additional action is required.


E_CL240D_JF_DIR_NOT_FOUND:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The journal file directory could not be found where the DBMS expected to
	find it. This message is followed in the error log by additional
	messages which specify which journal directory was missing, and where
	it should have been located.

	The most common reason for this error is that the journal file
	directory was accidentally deleted.

 System Status:
	Depending on the reason that the DBMS was trying to locate the journal
	file, the system status will vary. If the DBMS was trying to locate the
	journal file in order to add more records to it or to read records
	from it, then processing stops until the journal file can be restored
	from an operating system backup.

	If the DBMS was simply attempting to delete the journal file, then
	processing will continue (it is not considered a fatal error that the
	journal directory was missing, since the DBMS was planning to delete the
	file anyway).

 Recommendation:
	If the journal file must be read or written, restore the journal file
	from the appropriate operating system backup and retry the operation.

	If the journal file was about to be deleted anyway, this message
	is simply informational and no additional action is required.


E_CL240E_JF_BAD_LIST:SS08004_CONNECTION_REJECTED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The operating system rejected an attempt to list the contents of a
	journal file directory. The specific operating system error message is
	appended to this error message, if it is available. The problem may be
	due to file security violations, or to a disk or system error.

 System Status:
	The journal file operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Analyze the specific operating system error message for information
	about why the journal directory could not be examined. Take the
	appropriate actions to allow the DBMS to list the journal directory
	(alter the file security appropriately, repair the broken disk, etc.).


E_CL240F_JF_EXISTS:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The DBMS attempted to create a new journal file directory for a 
	database, but the journal file directory already exists.

 System Status:
	A message is printed indicating that a new journal file directory
	could not be created in the indicated location.

 Recommendation:
	Determine why the directory already exists. Examine the II_JOURNAL
	definition for correctness. Retry the operation.


E_CL2410_JF_BAD_DIR:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The operating system rejected a journal file operation because the
	journal file directory specification was in error. The specific
	operating system error message is appended to this error message, if it
	is available. The problem may be due to file security violations, or to
	a disk or system error, or to an erroneous definition of an environment
	variable.

 System Status:
	The journal file operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Analyze the specific operating system error message for information
	about why the journal directory could not be accessed. Take the
	appropriate actions to allow the DBMS to access the journal directory
	(alter the file security appropriately, repair the broken disk, etc.).


E_CL2411_JF_BAD_TRUNCATE:SS08004_CONNECTION_REJECTED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The operating system rejected an attempt to truncate a journal file.
	The specific operating system error message is appended to this error
	message, if it is available. The problem may be due to a disk error.

 System Status:
	The journal file operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Analyze the specific operating system error message for information
	about why the journal file could not be truncated. Take the appropriate
	actions to allow the DBMS to access the journal file (alter the file
	security appropriately, repair the broken disk, etc.).

E_CL2528_CS_ARG_USAGE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


E_CL2529_CS_SEM_OWNER_DEAD:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An owner of a semaphore controlling access to a resource shared across
	processes has exited.  The requesting process would "wait" forever for
	access to this resource if this error were not returned (possibly
	spinning, using all available CPU on the machine).

 System Status:
	Either the server or the installation will be shut down (depending on
	whether the resource is server- or installation-critical). In 6.3, there
	is a single semaphore controlling access to the buffer manager which
	is server-critical.  There are a few semaphores which control access to
	the logging and locking components which are installation-critical.

 Recommendation:
	Either restart the server or the installation, depending on whether the
	server or the installation was shut down.  Information in the error log
	may point to the cause of the semaphore failure.


E_CL252A_CS_FLOAT_ARG:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_CL2531_CS_ECHO_MISSING:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued by iirundbms if the echo template message
	(E_CL2530_CS_PARAM) could not be located in the error message
	file.  Since this message is in the same file, it is unlikely
	that the text of this message will be located as well, but at
	least we'll have a message ID to commence diagnosis.

 System Status:
	The server startup parameters will not be echoed.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure the installation process is complete.
	Contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_CL2532_CS_ECHO_SHORT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued by iirundbms if the echo template message
	(E_CL2530_CS_PARAM) is too short to contain both the parameter
	name and parameter value.

 System Status:
	The server startup parameters will not be echoed.

 Recommendation:
	Contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_CL2533_CS_ECHO_ERROR:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS

	Server or utility program startup will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_CL2537_CS_MAP_SSEG_FAIL:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This is an indication that the calling program could not attach to
	the shared memory known as the system segment.   The most common 
	causes of this problem are that either the data segment has not been 
	installed (via CSINSTALL), or that the program or user encountering
	the problem is not running with adequate privileges.

 System Status:
	Server or utility program startup will fail.

 Recommendation:
	If not running with adequate privileges, determine and obtain 
	required privs and try again.  If running with adequate 
	privileges, and if the installation is not up, use CSINSTALL 
	and to install the system segment and try again.  


E_CL2538_CS_EVINIT_FAIL:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This is an indication that a utility program failed in its
	attempt to initialize the CS event subsystem.  This may be the result 
	of insufficient privileges, or could indicate corruption of
	shared memory.

 System Status:
	Utility program startup will fail.

 Recommendation:
	If the installation is down, reinitialize the system segment with 
	CSINSTALL and try again.  If the installation is up, save the 
	errlog.log, iircp.log and all other ".log" files, and notify
   	Ingres Corporation technical support.

E_DM0066_BAD_KEY_TYPE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error occurs because one of the keys that has been requested of a
	modify or index operation is not suitable for being a key.  This can
	occur because the datatype is marked as either non-keyable or as
	non-sortable.  The DBMS requires that any attribute used as a key be
	sortable, as sorts are required as part of the modify and/or index
	operations.

 System Status:
	The index or modify operation is aborted.  Depending upon cursor state,
	the transaction may be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Alter the query so that the non-keyable field is not used as a key to
	the index or modify operation.


E_DM0067_READONLY_TABLE_ERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error occurs because one of the tables specified is a READONLY
	table.

 System Status:
	The DML or DDL statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Alter the table to NOREADONLY to allow the DML or DDL statement.


E_DM0068_MODIFY_READONLY_ERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to modify a non-base or DBMS table to either
	READONLY or NOREADONLY status.

 System Status:
	The MODIFY statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_DM0069_CONCURRENT_IDX_ERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to create a concurrent index on a non-READONLY
	table.

 System Status:
	The CREATE INDEX statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Modify the table to READONLY, create the concurrent indexes, then
	modify the table back to NOREADONLY.


E_DM006A_TRAN_ACCESS_CONFLICT:SS25000_INV_XACT_STATE


E_DM006B_SERVER_CLASS_ONCE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c - Server class name

 Explanation:
      This server class has 'ii.<host>.<class>.class_node_affinity' ON,
      and uses a private page cache.

 System Status:
      Server will not start.  This is expected behavior assuming
      a server of this class is truely active.

 Recommendation:
      Confirm that server of this class is already up and shut it down,
      or refrain from starting another instance of this class.


E_DM006C_SERVER_CLASS_ELSEWHERE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c - Server class name

 Explanation:
      This server class has 'ii.<host>.<class>.class_node_affinity' ON,
      and a server of this class is already active on another node.

 System Status:
      Server will not start.  This is expected behavior assuming
      a server of this class is truely active on another node in
      this cluster.

 Recommendation:
      Confirm that server of this class is already up on another
      node, and shut it down, or refrain from starting this class
      on this node.

E_DM00A0_UNKNOWN_COLLATION:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM00A1_ERROR_CONVERTING_TBL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered while converting a table from the 6.4
	(or lower) format to the current version. There should be previous
	messages in the error log detailing exactly what went wrong and the
	table or index affected.

	This problem should only occur when converting a database to the
	new version.

 System Status:
	The status of the database depends on which table or index the
	error occurred on. If a DBMS catalog was affected, the database
	will not be accessible by the new version of the DBMS until it can
	be properly converted.  If a user table was affected, the database
	should be available, but further errors will occur on the table
	with problems.

 Recommendation:
	If a DBMS catalog was affected, the problem must be resolved before
	the new version of the DBMS can access the database. For all other
	tables the user may be able to modify or reload the table. Secondary
	indexes should be dropped and recreated.  If all else fails, the
	database may be unloaded from the old version and reloaded into the
	new version.


E_DM00A2_CANT_CREATE_SECID:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered while creating a new security label ID.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Retry the operation, or free up some security label IDs.


E_DM00A3_TOO_MANY_SECID:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This database has too many security label IDs.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Retry the operation, or free up some security label IDs.


E_DM00A4_SYSMOD_TOO_MANY_ATTS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to MODIFY/SYSMOD a system catalog, but the
	catalog had too many attributes for internal data structure.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your Ingres Corporation Technical Support representative.


E_DM00A5_ATBL_UNSUPPORTED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to ADD or DROP a table column using the   
	ALTER TABLE statement, but the compatibility level of the   
	table is not sufficient to support row versioning.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Modify or re-Create the table with a supported compatibility 
	level.


E_DM00A6_ATBL_COL_INDEX_KEY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - column name
	%1c - table name

 Explanation:
	An 'ALTER TABLE tbl [DROP|ALTER] COLUMN col' statement was issued and   
	the column is a key column of the base table. Key columns are
	not allowed to be dropped or altered from the table.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Use a column that is not a base table key column. 


E_DM00A7_ATBL_COL_INDEX_SEC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - column name
	%1c - table name

 Explanation:
	An 'ALTER TABLE tbl DROP COLUMN col RESTRICT' statement was     
	issued and the column was found to be included in a secondary
	index. 

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Specify the CASCADE option instead of RESTRICT to destroy 
	dependent objects of the column.


E_DM00A8_BAD_ATT_ENTRY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0	'attid' Att number that is out of range.
	%1	Owner of table.
	%2	Table name.      
	%3	Database name.      
	%4	Total number of attributes expected for this table.

 Explanation:
	While obtaining information about the named table from the 
	iiattribute catalog, one of the entries in iiattributes was found
	to have an 'attid' out of range for that table. It is either
	less then 1 or greater than the total number of attributes (relatts)
	defined for this table.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected and the system catalog entries for the
	table are inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	Run VERIFYDB against the database, including dbms catalogs. Extra     
	attribute entries that appear to be duplicate or invalid may be deleted
	in runinteractive mode. If attributes are missing the table will
	likely have to be dropped and recreated/recovered.

	Also, notify CA-Ingres Technical Support.  Save errlog.log info and   
	try to determine what activity has occurred against that table.


E_DM00A9_BAD_ATT_COUNT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0	Number of attributes found in iiattribute.
	%1	Owner of table.
	%2	Table name.      
	%3	Database name.      
	%4	Total number of attributes expected for this table.

 Explanation:
	While obtaining information about the named table from the 
	iiattribute catalog, the number of attribute obtained was not equal
	to the number expected as per the relatts field of iirelation.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected and the system catalog entries for the
	table are inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	Run VERIFYDB against the database, including dbms catalogs. Extra     
	attribute entries that appear to be duplicate may be deleted in
	runinteractive mode. If attributes are missing the table will
	likely have to be dropped and recreated/recovered.

	Also, notify CA-Ingres Technical Support.  Save errlog.log info and   
	try to determine what activity has occurred against that table.


E_DM00AA_BAD_ATT_KEY_COUNT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0	Owner of table.
	%1	Table name.      
	%2	Database name.      
	%3	Number of key attributes expected.                  
	%4	Number of key attributes found.                     
	%5	The key number of the last key attribute read from iiattribute.

 Explanation:
	While obtaining information about the named table from the 
	iiattribute catalog, the number of attributes marked as being
	key fields did not equal the total number of key fields expected,
	OR a key number (ordinal position within the key) for a particular
	attribute was higher than the total number of key fields expected.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected and the system catalog entries for the
	table are inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	Run VERIFYDB against the database, including dbms catalogs. The number
	of key fields expected may be modified when in runinteractive mode
	in response to the S_DU0311_RESET_RELLOCOUNT message prompt.
	Once the catalogs have been been cleaned up sufficiently to allow
	access to the table, you may wish to rebuild the primary key structure
	via a modify command if the new number of key fields is not correct.

 Explanation:
	This error occurs when a check on a control block pointer failed.
	This error check was put in to avoid access violations/SIGSEGVs
	from occurring.

 System Status:
	The transaction will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Contact you Ingres Corporation Technical Support representative.

E_DM010C_TRAN_ABORTED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A force-abort occurs when the transaction log fills to the
	Force Abort level (configurable, but typically about 3/4 full).
	This transaction has been chosen to be forcibly aborted, to release
	transaction log space.

 System Status:
	The entire transaction is aborted, including the current statement.

 Recommendation:
	Reduce the size of the transaction;  or commit sooner if possible;
	or use the WITH ON_LOGFULL=COMMIT session setting;  or increase
	the size of the transaction log.

E_DM0130_DMLIST_ERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	DMF encountered an error during a dmm_list() request.  The error
	message indicating why dmm_list() failed is logged and translated
	to this message.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_DM0131_DMDEL_ERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	DMF encountered an error during a dmm_list() request.  The error
	message indicating why dmm_list() failed is logged and translated
	to this message.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_DM0132_ILLEGAL_STMT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM0133_ERROR_ACCESSING_DB:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM0134_DIS_DB_UNKNOWN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM0135_NO_GATEWAY:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A table marked as a Gateway table (DMT_GATEWAY bit is set in the
	iirelation.relstat field) was accessed, but the server is not
	connected to any gateways.

 System Status:
	The system remains OK, but no access will be allowed to gateway tables.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the user is connected to the correct server to access the
	requested data.  Make sure the server has been started correctly.


E_DM0136_GATEWAY_ERROR:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was returned on a call to the DMF Gateway.  The error log
	should contain a previous error message giving the exact nature of
	the error.

 System Status:
	The current query will be aborted; everything else should be OK.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for the exact nature of the gateway error.
	Make sure the intended gateway is available from the DBMS server.


E_DM0137_GATEWAY_ACCESS_ERROR:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An operation was specified for a gateway table that cannot be
	performed on foreign tables.  Such operations are:

		Set [no]journaling
		Modify to truncated
		Modify to merge
		Modify to reorganize
		Relocate

	These operations are allowed only on tables that are managed by
	the DBMS database system.

 System Status:
	The current query is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	These types of operations have no meaning to the DBMS system for
	gateway tables.  The user may want to alter the configuration of
	the table in the foreign database -- this should be done directly
	by the foreign database manager.


E_DM0138_TOO_MANY_PAGES:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The system will continue to operate.  An attempt was made to allocate a
	new page in a file which would exceed the page number limit (23 bits)
	imposed by TIDs.

 System Status:
	The query attempting this will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Contact the product vendor.  This is an internal limitation.  However,
	for the short term, the only real choice is to somehow make the table
	smaller.  Compression is a likely choice.


E_DM0139_ERROR_ALTERING_RCB:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	DMF encountered an error during a dmr_alter() call.  This probably
	indicates a protocol error by the caller of DMF.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_DM013A_INDEX_COUNT_MISMATCH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The dmt_show() requester must allocate memory to hold each secondary
	index (iiindex) tuple they request.  The number of indexes that
	really exist (determined from TCB) does not match the number that the
	caller requested.  Rather than risk an AV by overflowing the allocated
	memory, NO tuples are returned.

 System Status:
	RDF will do recovery by indicating the table has no secondary indexes.
	This will allow the query to continue, but a less than optimal
	query plan will be chosen.  However, QEF will find a timestamp
	difference (since RDF's copy of the iirelation tuple is obviously
	outdated), and will invalidate the query.  RDF should get current
	iirelation info on the retry, and this error condition should not be
	repeated.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_DM013B_LOC_NOT_AUTHORIZED:SS42503_INSUF_PRIV


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to access some location which has either been
	denied to the current session or is the improper type of location
	for the operation being attempted.

	This error should never be returned to the user; it is a DMF status
	indicator which should be translated by the caller into a user error.

 System Status:
	The statement will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	This error should never be reported to the user; if it is, please
	report this as a bug.


E_DM013C_BAD_LOC_TYPE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to perform some operation on a location of the
	incorrect type.  Only locations of a given type are allowed to undergo
	this operation.

	This error should never be returned to the user; it is a DMF status
	indicator which should be translated by the caller into a user error.

 System Status:
	The statement will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	This error should never be reported to the user; if it is, please
	report this as a bug.


E_DM013D_LOC_NOT_EXTENDED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The caller attempted an operation under the assumption that the
	current database was extended to the given location; however, upon
	searching the configuration file, the extent was not found.

	This error should never be returned to the user; it is a DMF status
	indicator which should be translated by the caller into a user error.

 System Status:
	The statement will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	This error should never be reported to the user; if it is, please
	report this as a bug.


E_DM013E_TOO_FEW_LOCS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The caller attempted an operation which requires a minimum of 1
	WORK location; this session has none.

	This error should never be returned to the user; it is a DMF status
	indicator which should be translated by the caller into a user error.

 System Status:
	The statement will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	This error should never be reported to the user; if it is, please
	report this as a bug.


E_DM013F_TOO_MANY_LOCS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The caller supplied too many WORK locations for the attempted operation.
	This operation supports a maximum of 256 WORK locations.

	This error should never be returned to the user; it is a DMF status
	indicator which should be translated by the caller into a user error.

 System Status:
	The statement will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	This error should never be reported to the user; if it is, please
	report this as a bug.


E_DM0140_EMPTY_DIRECTORY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The caller requested a dmm_list() operation on an empty directory.
	This is considered a recoverable error -- so the user should never
	see this message.

	dmm_list() initializes error to this before calling DIlistfile().
	If DIlistfile() returns with error still initialized to this value,
	then we can deduce that the directory was empty.  It is not illegal
	to have empty data directories (this can occur if you use accessdb to
	extend a database to a new location, but have not yet put any tables
	in that location.

	dmm_list() will translate this error back to a success status and
	continue.

 System Status:
	The statement will continue.

 Recommendation:
	This error should never be reported to the user; if it is, please
	report this as a bug.


E_DM0141_GWF_DATA_CVT_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error message is used internally by DMF to "remember" that a
	recoverable data conversion error occurred while processing a gateway
	table. The actual data conversion error has already been reported to
	the user. This error message is not reported to the user, nor is it
	logged. It is used internally to record that no additional logging
	of traceback information is needed while processing the data conversion
	error.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted. Note that not all gateways support query
	abort processing, so the query operations may or may not be undone.

 Recommendation:
	This error should never be reported to the user, nor should it ever be
	logged in the error log. If E_DM0141 is ever reported to a user or
	logged to the error log, it should be considered an internal error and
	reported to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM0142_GWF_ALREADY_REPORTED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error message is used internally by DMF to "remember" that a
	gateway facility call has returned a recoverable user error. The actual
	error has already been reported to the user. This message is not
	reported to the user, nor is it logged. It is used internally to
	record that no additional logging of traceback information is needed
	while processing the data conversion error.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted. Note that not all gateways support query
	abort processing, so the query operations may or may not be undone.

 Recommendation:
	This error should never be reported to the user, nor should it ever be
	logged in the error log. If E_DM0142 is ever reported to a user or
	logged to the error log, it should be considered an internal error and
	reported to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM0143_SAP_NOT_RUNNING:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error message is issued by a server at startup in a C2 or B1
	environment when the DMFSAP is not running.

 System Status:
	No servers will start until the DMFSAP process has been started.

 Recommendation:
	The DBMS system administrator should be contacted to deal with the
	problem.  Dealing with the problem usually involves re-starting the
	installation.


E_DM0144_NONFATAL_FINDBS_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error message is issued when a DMF error causes the internal
	procedure iiqef_find_dbs() to be aborted.  A previous message in
	the error log will indicate what the error is.

 System Status:
	The internal procedure processing will be aborted, but the transaction
	it occurred within will NOT be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user should look at the error log to see what the error is.
	The user should take the corrective action associated with that
	error.


E_DM0145_FATAL_FINDBS_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error message is issued when a fatal DMF error causes the internal
	procedure iiqef_find_dbs() to be aborted.  A previous message in the
	error log will indicate what the error is.  Currently, the only thing
	that will cause DMF to shut down the server during execution of
	internal procedure iiqef_find_dbs() is if DMF is unable to close a
	previously opened file.

 System Status:
	The server will attempt to gracefully shut itself down.  The transaction
	should be aborted in this process, so all finddbs work is backed out.

 Recommendation:
	The user should look at the error log to see what the error is.
	The user should take the corrective action associated with that
	error.


E_DM0146_SETLG_XCT_ABORT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A user session that had executed the SET NOLOGGING statement to bypass
	the logging system encountered an error while executing an update
	transaction. Since no logging was performed for this transaction,
	no recovery could be done.

	The database has been left in an unknown state -- likely inconsistent.
	The database has not, however, been marked "inconsistent".  The user
	must restore the database using a valid checkpoint in order to regain
	data consistency.

 System Status:
	The database is left in an inconsistent state -- while not actually
	being marked inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	The user should restore the database using a valid checkpoint.



E_DM0147_NOLG_BACKUP_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The user has attempted to issue the SET NOLOGGING statement in
	a database that is undergoing an online backup.

	The online backup algorithms depend on being able to read log
	records for all updates that occur during the backup process.
	These log records are placed in the DUMP file and used to restore
	the database to a consistent state when the backup is applied.

	Since a backup that is made with SET NOLOGGING updates running
	cannot be used by rollforwarddb, it is disallowed.

 System Status:
	The session will not run in SET NOLOGGING mode.  The SET NOLOGGING
	statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Wait until the backup operation is complete to run the NOLOGGING
	application.


E_DM0148_USER_QUAL_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This is an internal error and should never be seen by a user. It occurs
	when DMF has made a call to QEF to verify if a tuple meets the query
	qualification. If an error is encountered during this operation, QEF
	instructs DMF to return this error.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	This error should never be reported to the user, nor should it ever be
	logged in the error log. If E_DM0148 is ever reported to a user or
	logged to the error log, it should be considered an internal error and
	reported to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM0149_SETLG_SVPT_ABORT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A user session that had executed the SET NOLOGGING statement to bypass
	the logging system has requested a rollback to a previous savepoint.
	Since no logging was performed for this transaction, the request cannot
	be processed.

	This error is never actually logged to any system log file nor returned
	to the user.  It is used a an external return code from the dmx_abort()
	routine.

	   and end of the identifier.  VMS requires that objects be enclosed
	   in double quotes.)  Escape characters are also required to
	   include certain objects in the string.

	 - Invalid character embedded in the object. Allowed characters are:
		space           double quote    percent         ampersand
		quote           left paren      r paren         asterisk
		plus            comma           minus           period

E_DM1144_CPP_DEAD_ARCHIVER:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Either the online checkpoint facility or the auditdb process
 	failed when the archiver (dmfacp) failed.  Both online
	checkpoint and "auditdb -wait" depend on the archiver to
	successfully function.

	If occurring during an online checkpoint, this error occurred
	early on in the online checkpoint processing.

	Check both the error log file and the ACP log file for more
	information concerning the cause of the failures.

 System Status:
	If the error occurred during "ckpdb", online checkpoint processing
	aborts.  If the error occurred during "auditdb -wait", auditdb aborts.

 Recommendation:
	After successfully restarting the archiver process (dmfacp), restart
	the failed operation.


E_DM1145_CPP_DEAD_ARCHIVER:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The online checkpoint facility failed when the archiver (dmfacp) 
	failed.  The online checkpoint facility depends on the archiver 
	to successfully function in order to guarantee a consistent 
	checkpoint of the database.  This error occurred early in the 
	online checkpoint process.

	Check both the error log file and the ACP log file for more
	information concerning the cause of the failures.

 System Status:
	Online checkpoint processing aborts.

	information concerning the cause of the failures.

 System Status:
	Online checkpoint processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	After successfully restarting the archiver process (dmfacp), restart
	the online checkpoint.



E_DM1147_CPP_DEAD_ARCHIVER:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The online checkpoint facility failed when the archiver (dmfacp) 
	failed.  The online checkpoint facility depends on the archiver 
	to successfully function in order to guarantee a consistent 
	checkpoint of the database.  This error occurred early in the 
	online checkpoint process.

	Check both the error log and the ACP log file for more
	information concerning the cause of the failures.

 System Status:
	Online checkpoint processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	After successfully restarting the archiver process (dmfacp), restart
	the online checkpoint.



E_DM1148_CPP_CNF_DUMP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The online checkpoint facility saves a copy of the database
	configuration file in the database DUMP directory (II_DUMP).  This
	error is raised when it is unable to do so.

	This message should be preceded by a more detailed error message
	in the error log which gives more information on the cause of the error.

	This error could be caused by the system being out of disk space
	on the DUMP device.

 System Status:
	Online checkpoint processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Check previous error messages in the error log file for the cause
	of the error.  After correcting the problem, restart online checkpoint.
	If the problem cannot be resolved, try using OFFLINE checkpoint
	(-l flag).


E_DM1149_CPP_BACKUP_FAILURE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	The online checkpoint facility failed when the archiver (dmfacp) 
	failed.  The online checkpoint facility depends on the archiver 
	to successfully function in order to guarantee a consistent 
	checkpoint of the database.  This error occurred early in the 
	online checkpoint process.

	Check both the error log file and the ACP log file for more
	information concerning the cause of the failures.

	After successfully restarting the archiver process (dmfacp), restart
	the online checkpoint.


E_DM1150_CPP_BACKUP_FAILURE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The online checkpoint facility failed when the archiver (dmfacp) 
	failed.  The online checkpoint facility depends on the archiver 
	to successfully function in order to guarantee a consistent 
	checkpoint of the database.  This error occurred early in the online 
	checkpoint process.

	Check both the error log and the ACP log file for more information
	concerning the cause of the failures.

 System Status:
	Online checkpoint processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Look for additional error information in the ACP log file.  After
	resolving these errors (usually out of disk space), restart the
	online checkpoint of the database.


E_DM1151_CPP_CPNEEDED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The online checkpoint facility failed when it could not
	successfully execute a consistency point.

	At some points during the backup, the checkpoint facility must
	signal a consistency point and then wait for that consistency
	point to complete.  This is generally in order to form a complete
	archive window on which the ACP can then do archive processing.

	If the checkpoint process gets an error signaling or waiting for
	the consistency point, then this error will be raised.  There
	should be previous error messages in the error log giving more
	detail about what went wrong.

 System Status:
	Checkpoint processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Look for additional error information in the error log.  After
	resolving these errors, restart the checkpoint of the database.


E_DM1152_CPP_ONLINE_PURGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The online checkpoint facility failed when it could not
	successfully execute an Online Purge.

	During an online checkpoint, the checkpoint facility must
	signal the archiver to execute an Online Purge of the database
	being backed up.

	If the checkpoint process gets an error signaling or waiting for
	the purge, then this error will be raised.  There should be
	previous error messages in the error log giving more detail about
	what went wrong.

 System Status:
	Checkpoint processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Look for additional error information in the error log.  After
	resolving these errors, restart the checkpoint of the database.


E_DM1153_CPP_CLUSTER_MERGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The online checkpoint facility failed when it could not
	successfully merge old journal files in a cluster installation.

	When a checkpoint is performed in a cluster installation, we must
	take all the old journal files created for each node and merge
	the records into a single journal file.

	This is done by the checkpoint process.  If this operation fails,
	this error is raised and the checkpoint aborts.

	There should be previous error messages in the error log describing
	in more detail the exact nature of the problem.

 System Status:
	Checkpoint processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Look for additional error information in the error log.  After
	resolving these errors, restart the checkpoint of the database.


E_DM1154_CPP_CLUSTER_BUSY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	0c - database name
	2c - formatted list of node names
	1x - bitmask of node IDs

 Explanation:
	When an online checkpoint is run in a cluster installation, the
	database can only be open on the node which is executing the
	checkpoint.  No other node can have the database open at the
	time the checkpoint starts.

	This is so journal records can be flushed to the journal files
	before the checkpoint begins.

	The database must be closed on all other nodes of the cluster
	before the checkpoint can begin.

 System Status:
	Checkpoint processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Close the database on all nodes except the one on which the
	checkpoint is being executed, then restart the online checkpoint.


E_DM1155_CPP_TMPL_MISSING:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Individual installations will in future releases be able to customize
	the behavior of the checkpoint and restore operations by specifying
	the contents of a checkpoint template file in the II_CONFIG area. This
	file, "cktmpl.def", could not be found.

	When the checkpoint template file cannot be found, checkpoint and
	rollforward cannot be run. The file may be missing because the
	installation encountered errors, or because the file was accidentally 
	deleted or renamed.

	The default location for "cktmpl.def" can be overridden by setting
	II_CKTMPL_FILE symbol.  If II_CKTMPL_FILE is used, it must be set
	to the fully-qualified filename of the checkpoint template file.

 System Status:
	The checkpoint is halted, and this error is displayed. Additional
	error messages are logged in the error log file.

 Recommendation:
	If II_CKTMPL_FILE was used to explicitly specify the location of the
	checkpoint template file, ensure that the value of II_CKTMPL_FILE
	is correct and that the file is located in the indicated location.

	If II_CKTPML_FILE was not used, ensure that the file, "cktmpl.def",
	is present and readable in the standard location.  Check the file
	permissions to verify that the file can be read by the user who is
	running the checkpoint or rollforward.


E_DM1156_CPP_NOLOGGING:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The user has attempted to checkpoint a database that is currently
	open by a session which has issued the SET NOLOGGING statement.
	This statement directs that no logging should be performed by that
	session.

	The online backup algorithms depend on being able to read log
	records for all updates that occur during the backup process.
	These log records are placed into the DUMP file and used to restore
	the database to a consistent state when the backup is applied.

	Since a backup made with SET NOLOGGING updates running cannot be
	used by rollforwarddb, it is disallowed.

 System Status:
	The checkpoint command will return this error and the checkpoint
	will be halted.

 Recommendation:
	Wait until SET NOLOGGING updates are complete, then re-issue the
	checkpoint command.


E_DM1157_CPP_DISABLE_JNL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The user has attempted to checkpoint a journal-disabled database.
	To checkpoint such a database one must also request to either
	reenable ("ckpdb +j") or disable ("ckpdb -j") journaling.

 System Status:
	The checkpoint command will return this error and the checkpoint
	will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Re-run ckpdb with either the "+j" or "-j" option.

 Explanation:
	The offline checkpoint facility failed when it could not
	successfully execute an Offline Purge.

	During an offline checkpoint, the checkpoint facility must
	signal the archiver to execute a purge of the database
	being backed up.

	If the checkpoint process gets an error signaling or waiting for
	the purge, then this error will be raised.  There should be
	previous error messages in the error log giving more detail about
	what went wrong.

 System Status:
	Checkpoint processing aborts.

	The auditdb process will stop.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the table name, then retry the operation.

E_DM120F_ATP_TBL_NOTFOUND:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM1210_ATP_BAD_TRL_CREATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered creating the file "audit.trl" in the
	current directory.  This file is created when the audit-file
	option is specified for auditdb.  This file will hold all of
	the audit trail output.

	This error probably indicates file-create permissions problems,
	but could also be caused by disk resource limitations.

 System Status:
	The auditdb process will not start.

 Recommendation:
	Check for permissions to create a file in the current directory;
	check for sufficient disk space.


E_DM1211_ATP_MEM_ALLOCATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered allocating memory during startup of the
	auditdb process.  This is probably caused by insufficient
	memory resources.

 System Status:
	The auditdb process will not start.

 Recommendation:
	Check for previous errors which indicate the amount of memory
	requested.  Check process quotas, if any.  Check system memory
	usage.


E_DM1212_ATP_DISPLAY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered in the routine which formats and displays
	journal records for audit processing.  A previous error message
	in the error log should give more specific details about the display
	error.

	This error could be caused by display format errors or by the
	inability of the system to allocate a buffer large enough to
	hold the row.

 System Status:
	Auditdb will skip the row which it cannot display and go on to the
	next record.  It is possible that this error could continue to
	be displayed for each record in the audit trail if the problem
	is not specific to a single record.

 Recommendation:
	Check for previously logged errors which give further detail on
	the problem.  If caused by a memory problem, check for process
	memory quotas.


E_DM1213_ATP_COLUMN_DISPLAY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - column number of bad data value

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered converting a data value into its
	display format (VARCHAR) during auditdb processing.

	When displaying records in an audit trail, auditdb calls
	ADF to convert each column datatype to VARCHAR so that it
	can be displayed.  If an error is returned from the conversion,
	the column cannot be displayed.

	This error probably indicates a bad or unknown data value.

	If the column is of a User-Defined Datatype (UDT), check the user
	routine that converts the datatype to VARCHAR format.

 System Status:
	The indicated column will not be displayed; audit processing will
	continue.

 Recommendation:
	Check for bad data values in the indicated table/column.
	Check for previous error messages giving more detail about
	the nature of the conversion error.


E_DM1214_ATP_DISPLAY_OVFL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	During audit processing, a row was encountered which, when each
	column was converted to VARCHAR format, could not be displayed in
	a 16,000 byte display buffer.

	Rows larger than 16,000 bytes cannot be displayed in audit trails.

 System Status:
	The row will be truncated for display; audit processing will
	continue.

 Recommendation:
	Check previous error messages for conversion errors.  Check if
	row contains User-Defined Datatypes (UDTs) that require large
	amounts of space when converted to ASCII format.


E_DM1215_ATP_TBL_NONEXIST:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - user-specified table name

 Explanation:
	A table specified on the auditdb command line does not exist.

 System Status:
	The auditdb process will stop.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the table name, then retry the operation.


E_DM1216_ATP_WAIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was detected in "auditdb -wait" processing.  A common
	cause of this problem is that the archiver process (dmfacp)
	is dead.  Previous messages in the error log should identify
	the problem more precisely.

 System Status:
	The auditdb process will stop.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the underlying problem, then retry the operation.


E_DM1217_ATP_DLM_FNAME:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The DBMS permits table names to contain delimited identifiers,
 	and allows such names to be present in an AUDITDB command
	line, but does not allow these names to be used in the automatic
	generation of file names.  That is, AUDITDB commands of the form:

	  AUDITDB <dbname> -table='""Delim tbl""' -file"    (UNIX example)

	fail with this error.  In this case, users must explicitly specify a
	file name, for example as:

	  AUDITDB <dbname> -table='""Delim tbl""' -file=delim_tbl.trl

	This restriction is imposed because operating system command
	languages and shell programs do not handle delimited characters in
	a consistent fashion.

 System Status:
	The auditdb process will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Rerun auditdb, explicitly specifying the name of the desired
	output file(s).


E_DM1218_ATP_OROW_COMPRESS:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The DBMS supports a mode in which "old row" information in replace
	log (and journal) records is compressed (trace point dm902).  When
	old rows are compressed in this manner, auditdb cannot build a
	copy of the row, and hence cannot accomplish the requested task.

 System Status:
	The auditdb process will fail.

 Recommendation:
	If old-row compression is enabled, the "-file" option to auditdb is
	not supported; auditdb may be run without the "-file" option to view
	the compressed row contents.  The auditdb "-b"/"-e" options may be
	useful in excluding the troublesome rows from "-file" output.


E_DM1219_ATP_INV_CKP:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The AUDITDB #c parameter requires a valid checkpoint sequence
	number.

 System Status:
	The auditdb process will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Rerun AUDITDB specifying a valid checkpoint sequence number.


E_DM121A_ATP_LSN_NO_ALL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The AUDITDB -start_lsn and -end_lsn options require
	the use of the -all parameter.  -start_lsn and -end_lsn
	options are not supported for non -all output.

 System Status:
	The auditdb process will not start.

 Recommendation:
	Add -all to the parameter list and try the request again.
	Note that the format of -all output is not the same as
	that for normal auditdb output.


E_DM121B_ATP_NOEMPTY_TUPLE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
	The output to the file for the -aborted_transaction flag of auditdb may be 
	incorrectly formatted. 

 System Status:
      The auditdb process will continue but the file output may be
	corrupted.

 Parameters:
      %0c      - database name
      %1c	 - checkpoint file name
      %2c      - location name

 Explanation:
	If during a rollforward it is found that a checkpoint file
	associated with a specific location is not found, this error
	is issued.  This is expected in the current release
	if the location has been created since the last checkpoint.

 System Status:
	If a new location was added to the database since the last
	checkpoint, this is an expected condition.  If not, the
	rollforward will likely fail.  This error in itself does not
	cause the recovery to fail.

 Recommendation:
	If the checkpoint has been inadvertently deleted, restore it.
	If the checkpoint is bad, attempt recovery from a prior
	checkpoint.

 Parameters:
	%0d - Rawdata journal record type code
	%1d - Current record offset
	%2d - Current record data size
	%3d - Total object size from initial rawdata journal record

 Explanation:
	An inconsistency between the size of the current "rawdata"
	journal record and the initial "rawdata" record has been detected.
	This is caused by some sort of garbling of the journal stream.

 System Status:
	Journal processing is halted unless the -ignore flag was
	used.  The database will be marked inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	This error indicates either a damaged journal file, or an internal
	error.  Contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

E_DM133A_RFP_DMP_SCAN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM133B_RFP_DUMP_CONFIG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	During an online checkpoint, the DBMS writes a copy of the config
	file to the database DUMP directory (II_DUMP).  When restoring
	to that checkpoint, the config file is overwritten with the
	contents in the DUMP copy.

	This error is raised when rollforwarddb is unable to restore the
	config file using the DUMP copy.  This may occur because of I/O
	errors, permission errors, or if the config copy is missing.

	The DUMP copy of the config file will be named "cnnnnnn.dmp" where
	"nnnnnn" is the checkpoint sequence number.

	This message should be preceded by more detailed error messages
	in the error log giving the exact nature of the error.

 System Status:
	Rollforward processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Check previous error messages to determine if the problem can be
	resolved by fixing system conditions (freeing disk space, bringing
	disk volume on-line, etc.).  If the problem seems to be that config
	file copy is corrupted, then the checkpoint may not be usable.  It is
	possible that using a different copy of the config file will resolve
	the problem.


E_DM133C_RFP_UNUSABLE_CKP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued by the rollforwarddb utility when the checkpoint
	which was to be used is discovered to be unusable. In order for a
	checkpoint to be usable for rolling forward a database, the backup
	operation must have successfully written all the locations which
	comprise the database to the backup area (whether disk or tape).

	Additionally, if the checkpoint was an online checkpoint, the archiver
	must have successfully copied all the transaction and backup information
	from the transaction log file to the journal and dump files associated 
	with this checkpoint.

	If any or all of these operations fail, the checkpoint is marked as
	INVALID and cannot be used for rolling forward the database.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb operation is aborted. The database is unaltered. No
	action has been taken on the database.

 Recommendation:
	Depending on what has been done with this database in the past, there
	may be a valid checkpoint earlier in the history of this database. The
	infodb utility may be used to display the checkpoint history of this
	database. If a previous checkpoint is marked as valid, the database
	can be recovered by rolling forward from the previous checkpoint.

	You can restore your database from the most recent valid checkpoint by
	re-issuing the rollforwarddb command with the "#c" argument.

	If the "#c" argument is used, the database will be rolled back to the
	most recent valid checkpoint, and the database will be rolled forward
	by re-applying all transactions which have been executed since the
	checkpoint was taken. The transaction information is kept in the
	journal files.


E_DM133D_RFP_UNDO_INCOMPLETE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The rollforwarddb process was unable to resolve all of the transactions
	left open at the end of the database journal history. During
	rollforward, all transactions contained in the journal files are
	restored in the database.  Any transactions which are not completed
	by an End Transaction record in journal files must then be rolled
	back to bring the database to a consistent state.  During this rollback
	phase, rollforwarddb was unable to find the Begin Transaction records
	for all of the incomplete transactions.

	This error occurs if the rollforwarddb process reads back through all
	the journal files in the database without finding the Beginning of
	all of the incomplete transactions.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb process will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Check for previous errors in the error log.  Run "auditdb #a" to get
	a full listing of the journal file contents.  Run "rollforwarddb #x"
	to get a trace file listing of the rollforward events for use by 
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM133E_RFP_ROLLBACK_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The rollforwarddb process was unable to resolve all of the transactions
	left open at the end of the database journal history. During
	rollforward, all transactions contained in the journal files are
	restored in the database.  Any transactions which are not completed
	by an End Transaction record in journal files must then be rolled
	back to bring the database to a consistent state.  During this rollback
	phase, rollforwarddb was unable to find the Begin Transaction records
	for all of the incomplete transactions.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb process will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Check for previous errors in the error log.  Run "auditdb #a" to get
	a full listing of the journal file contents.  Run "rollforwarddb #x"
	to get a trace file listing of the rollforward events for use by 
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM133F_RFP_UNDO_BEGIN_XACT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The rollforwarddb process was unable to resolve all of the transactions
	left open at the end of the database journal history. During
	rollforward, all transactions contained in the journal files are
	restored in the database.  Any transactions which are not completed
	by an End Transaction record in journal files must then be rolled
	back to bring the database to a consistent state.

	This error occurred while trying to begin a transaction and restore
	its context to that of the original transaction being rolled back.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb process will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Check for previous errors in the error log.  Run "auditdb #a" to get
	a full listing of the journal file contents.  Run "rollforwarddb #x"
	to get a trace file listing of the rollforward events for use by 
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM1340_RFP_PREPARE_UNDO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The rollforwarddb process was unable to resolve all of the transactions
	left open at the end of the database journal history. During
	rollforward, all transactions contained in the journal files are
	restored in the database.  Any transactions which are not completed
	by an End Transaction record in journal files must then be rolled
	back to bring the database to a consistent state.

	This error occurred while trying to open the database and transactions
	necessary to restore the original context for rollback processing.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb process will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Check for previous errors in the error log.  Run "auditdb #a" to get
	a full listing of the journal file contents.  Run "rollforwarddb #x"
	to get a trace file listing of the rollforward events for use by 
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM1341_RFP_CLEANUP_UNDO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The rollforwarddb process was unable to resolve all of the transactions
	left open at the end of the database journal history. During
	rollforward, all transactions contained in the journal files are
	restored in the database.  Any transactions which are not completed
	by an End Transaction record in journal files must then be rolled
	back to bring the database to a consistent state.

	This error occurred after the successful rollback of all the
	incomplete transactions while trying to end the open transactions
	and close the database.

	If the error occurred after the writing of the End Transaction
	records, then the database will actually be restored correctly
	in spite of the error.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb process will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Check for previous errors in the error log. It is possible that the
	rollforwarddb process was able to correctly restore the database before
	failing.  Run rollforwarddb a second time to see if the same error
	occurs.  If the first rollforwarddb process was able to write the
	End Transaction records before failing, then it is possible that the
	second rollforwarddb process will succeed.


E_DM1342_RFP_INCOMPLETE_UNDO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR

E_DM1345_RFP_XACT_UNDO_FAIL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c      - database name
	%1x, %2x - transaction ID (8-byte)

 Explanation:
	The rollforwarddb process was unable to resolve all of the transactions
	left open at the end of the database journal history. During
	rollforward, all transactions contained in the journal files are
	restored in the database.  Any transactions which are not completed
	by an End Transaction record in journal files must then be rolled

	phase, rollforwarddb was unable to find the Begin Transaction records
	for all of the incomplete transactions.

	This error occurs if the rollforwarddb process reads back through all
	the journal files in the database without finding the Beginning of
	all of the incomplete transactions.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb process will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Check for previous errors in the error log.  Run "auditdb #a" to get
	a full listing of the journal file contents.  Run "rollforwarddb #x"
	to get a trace file listing of the rollforward events for use by 
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM1346_RFP_NOLOGGING:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	This warning is issued by the rollforwarddb process when a
	"rollforwarddb -nologging" command has been issued.  This unsupported
	rollforwarddb option is designed to be used in controlled
	environments where a "ckpdb" is issued immediately after the
	rollforwarddb.  If a checkpoint is not performed after this
	command, a second rollforward recovery performed after this one
	could leave the database in a corrupted state.

 System Status:
	The system status has not changed.

 Recommendation:
	This is a warning.  If this command was issued inappropriately,
	reissue the rollforward request without the -nologging option.


E_DM1347_RFP_NOROLLBACK:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	This warning message is issued by the rollforwarddb process when
	a "rollforwarddb -norollback" command has been issued.  This unsupported
	rollforwarddb option is designed to be used in a test environment
	or under tightly controlled circumstances, and may well leave the
	database in an inconsistent state.  Messages output during the
	rollforward inform the user if transactions requiring rollback were
	skipped, and flag that the database is indeed inconsistent.

 System Status:
	The system status has not changed.

 Recommendation:
	This is a warning.  If this command was issued inappropriately,
	reissue the rollforwarddb request without the -norollback option.


E_DM1348_RFP_CHECK_NOCKP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error is a traceback message that is logged when an error
	is encountered during rollforward processing while validating the
	user command flag "-c".  The error in this case probably occurred
	attempting to check the database status in the config file.

	Since this is a traceback message, there should be previous errors
	logged which give more details on the specific problem.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb will fail.  The database will be unchanged.

 Recommendation:
	Check for previous error messages to facilitate resolving the problem.


E_DM1349_RFP_END_TIME:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	This warning is issued by the rollforwarddb process when a
	"rollforwarddb -e" request ("end-time") has been issued.  This option
	is used when it is desired to apply only a subset of the journal
	history (for example, when a table is inadvertently dropped).  No
	CLR logging is performed by the rollforwarddb process during this
	type of recovery, making the database subject to silent database
	corruption if the feature is used incorrectly.

	As the state of the database is not fully consistent with the state
	of the journals at the completion of this rollforward, the only
	supported actions that may be taken after this point are to
	either checkpoint the database or to perform another rollforwarddb
	(perhaps also with -b/-e options).  In any case, NO TRANSACTION
	PROCESSING CAN TAKE PLACE ON THIS DATABASE UNTIL AFTER IT HAS
	BEEN CHECKPOINTED.

 System Status:
	The system status has not changed.

 Recommendation:
	This is a warning.


E_DM134A_RFP_SPURIOUS_FILE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - file name
	%1c - path name

 Explanation:
	This error is given when rollforwarddb encounters an error either
	attempting to delete a temporary file or attempting to create
	an End Transaction action control block associated with deleting
	a temporary file.

	It does not adversely affect rollforwarddb processing other than that
	it leaves the unneeded file in the database directory.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb operation will continue.

 Recommendation:
	Check for previous error messages to facilitate resolving the problem.
	Run sysmod or ckpdb to clean up any leftover files.


E_DM134B_RFP_ACTION_LIST:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Rollforwarddb keeps track of some types of operations that it may
	later need information about in order to complete a related recovery
	action.  These types of operations include:

	  - Deletion of physical files (which are delayed until end
	      transaction)

	  - Undo of system catalog updates associated with non-journaled
	      tables (in which the original update may have been skipped)

	This error is given when an action entry could not be allocated by
	rollforwarddb in order to keep track of one of these operations.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb operation will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Check for previous error messages to facilitate resolving the problem.
	Most likely this error is the result of running out of memory resources.


E_DM134C_RFP_INV_CHECKPOINT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - specified checkpoint sequence number
	%1d - checkpoint sequence number of last valid checkpoint

 Explanation:
	A "rollforwarddb #c" request has been received, but the checkpoint 
	does not correspond to a state from which a rollforward may take
	place.  The DBMS determines whether a checkpoint is usable for a
	rollforwarddb by ensuring that the database was journaled at 
	the time that the checkpoint was made, and that it remained 
	journaled up to the current time.
	 
	It is possible, of course, to roll the database back to its
	state at any prior (successful) checkpoint via "rollforwarddb #c -j".
	This would not be called for, however, except in the most severe
  	circumstances where later checkpoints and journals were lost.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb operation will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Specify a checkpoint sequence number after the point at which 
	journaling was enabled (or re-enabled) on the database.


W_DM134D_RFP_NONJNL_TAB_DEL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c		Database name
	%1c		Table name
	%2c		Owner name

 Explanation:
	ROLLFORWARDDB drops (deletes) non-journaled tables that have been 
	dropped since the last checkpoint (but created prior to the 
	checkpoint).  This is a warning that the specified table has been 
	dropped. 

 System Status:
	No change, this is a warning only.

 Recommendation:
	If the table drop cannot be tolerated, possible courses of action
	are as follows.

	1) If the table was up-to-date as of the last checkpoint, restore the 
	   checkpoint with rollforwarddb -j, UNLOAD the table, and then reload it 
	   after completion of the rollforward recovery.

	2) If the table had been updated since the last checkpoint, and those 
	   updates cannot easily be recovered, use auditdb to find out time 
	   at which the table was dropped, then run rollforwarddb -e to recover 
	   the database to a point prior to that drop.  Then unload the table, 
	   and rerun rollforward to recover the database completely (without
	   the -e flag).  Finally, reload the table after recovery completes.

	In any case, Ingres Corporation recommends that journaling all 
	tables in journaled databases.


E_DM134E_RFP_LAST_TABID:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c		Database name
	%1d		original last table id
	%2d		recovered last table id

 Explanation:
	ROLLFORWARDDB recovers the dsc_last_table_id field of the config
	file by replacing it with the original config file version.
	However, ROLLFORWARDDB also provides a second, independent means of 
	tracking the recovery of this field through table creation 
	log records.  This error is issued when the two values conflict.  

 System Status:
	No change.  This is as a consistency check and is not an expected
	condition.

 Recommendation:
	Run verifydb against the database, including dbms catalogs, after the 
	recovery completes.  This should detect table id conflicts.

	Also, notify Ingres Corporation Technical Support.  Save 
	"auditdb -all" output run against the database journal files, 
	and a copy of the database INFODB output.  Also, save the copies 
	of the config files on the database, journal and dump directories 
	(all files named "aaaaaaaaa").


E_DM134F_RFP_INV_JNL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	A rollforwarddb is being done on a database which has had incomplete
	journals.  This is not a supported operation.

	Since journaling are incomplete, the database journal information
	is not consistent.  Rolling forward using incomplete journal
	records is not supported -- although may sometimes be done using the
	appropriate "-e" flag setting to rollforwarddb up to the point at which
	errors began occurring.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb process will continue only if the "#f" flag was
	specified.

 Recommendation:
	Evaluate whether rollforward processing is really desired.
	Use "rollforwarddb #f" to force rollforward to proceed.


E_DM1351_RFP_BTIME_NOFORCE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error is issued by the rollforwarddb process when a
	"rollforwarddb -b" request ("begin-time") has been issued without
	the force flag (#f).  This form of recovery is used when it is 
	desired to apply only a subset of the journal history, but
	is very dangerous because page-oriented recovery algorithms are 
	very unforgiving of attempts to skip parts of
	a journal file.  Recoveries of this type should not 
	attempted unless they immediately follow a 

	 ROLLFORWARDDB -e -norollback 

	recovery that specifies the same time.

	If it is absolutely necessary to skip segments of the journal 
	file, rollforwarddb -start_lsn and -end_lsn should be used, 
	which permit a greater degree of control over exactly which 
	journal records are skipped.
 
 System Status:
	The system status has not changed. 

 Recommendation:
	Use of rollforwarddb -b is strongly discouraged, 
	except when preceded by a rollforwarddb -e -norollback with
	exactly the same time.  The -end_lsn and -start_lsn parameters 
	are preferred for recoveries in which certain journal records
	must be skipped.  All such recovery attempts should 
	be coordinated with Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

	If -b is required, rerun the recovery specifying the #f flag.


E_DM1352_RFP_NOCKP_NOFORCE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error is issued by the rollforwarddb process when a
	"rollforwarddb -c" request has been received without  
	the force flag (#f).  This type of recovery is used when it is 
	desired to start recovery at a point at which a prior 
	recovery completed.  This is very risky unless the time 
	(or lsn) at which the -c recovery is to commence is precisely 
	the same time (or lsn) at which the prior recovery completed.  
	Skipping any part of a journal file is very likely 
	to cause the recovery to fail or the database to become corrupt.

	If it is absolutely necessary to skip segments of the journal 
	file, rollforwarddb -start_lsn and -end_lsn should be used, 
	which permit a greater degree of control over exactly which 
	journal records are skipped.  Any such recovery attempt should 
	be coordinated with Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

 System Status:
	The system status has not changed. 

 Recommendation:
	Use of rollforwarddb -c is discouraged.  If it is absolutely 
	required, rerun the recovery specifying the #f flag.  

	If -c is required, rerun the recovery specifying the #f flag.


E_DM1353_RFP_SLSN_NOFORCE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error is issued by the rollforwarddb process when a
	"rollforwarddb -start_lsn" request has been issued without
	the force flag (#f).  This form of recovery is used when it is 
	desired to apply only a subset of the journal history, but
	is very dangerous because page-oriented recovery algorithms are 
	very unforgiving of attempts to skip parts of a journal file.  
	Recoveries of this type should generally not be attempted unless 
	they immediately follow a prior request of the form: 

	 ROLLFORWARDDB -end_lsn=aa,bb -norollback 

	where -start_lsn equals -end_lsn.  (Or when a rollforwarddb -j
	has just been issued, in which case the -start_lsn should
	correspond to the first record in the first journal file
	of the checkpoint.)

	Recoveries of this type should also include the -c flag, as they 
	imply a continuation of a prior recovery.
 
 System Status:
	The system status has not changed. 

 Recommendation:
	Use of rollforwarddb -start_lsn is an unsupported and very
	dangerous action, except when preceded by a rollforwarddb -end_lsn 
	-norollback with exactly the same lsn.  All such recovery attempts
	should be coordinated with Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

	If -start_lsn is required, rerun the recovery specifying the #f 
	flag.

 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A security DML operation was requested which was rejected due to 
	insufficient privileges.

 System status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_DM201F_ROW_TABLE_LABEL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to set a row security label which did not 
	dominate its table security label. This is not allowed.

 System status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	None.


W_DM5001_BAD_PG_NUMBER:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - real page number
	%1d - page number that appears on page

 Explanation:
	The page_page field contains the page number in the file.  In this
	case, the page number is incorrect on the data page.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message printed during the check/patch operation.

 Recommendation:
	If the check operation is in process, the user must decide if they
	want to run the patch operation.  This operation will fix the diagnosed
	problem, but will also convert the table to heap and destroy all
	secondary indexes on the table.  NOTE: If this is the check operation
	and a secondary index is being examined, the user should drop the
	secondary index and recreate it.


W_DM5002_BAD_DATA_PAGESTAT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The page_stat field indicates the page type.  In this case, the page
	is believed to be a data page.  However, the page_stat has bits set
	indicating it is some other type of page.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message printed during the check/patch operation.

 Recommendation:
	If the check operation is in process, the user must decide if they
	want to run the patch operation.  This operation will fix the diagnosed
	problem, but will also convert the table to heap and destroy all
	secondary indexes on the table.  NOTE: If this is the check operation
	and a secondary index is being examined, the user should drop the
	secondary index and recreate it.


W_DM5003_UNEXPECTED_VERSION:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - version

 Explanation:
	Page->page_version is usually set to zero, as it is currently an
	unused field on the page.  It had a non-zero value.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message printed during the check/patch operation.

 Recommendation:
	None required for this message.


W_DM5004_STRUCTURAL_DAMAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	A data page consists of a header section, a structural section, and a
	data section. The structural section is used to locate tuples in the
	data section.  If damage occurs to the structural section, then DMF
	cannot find the data associated with specific tuples on the page. There
	is no way to recover from this other than throwing away all tuples on
	this page.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message printed during the check/patch operation.

 Recommendation:
	If this is a check operation, the user must decide whether or not to
	patch. If the user patches, then the user will lose all data on this
	page. If this is a patch operation, all data on this page will be
	deleted.


W_DM5005_INVALID_TID:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	The check/patch operation has already verified that the page is
	structurally sound.  However, for some reason, it is not possible to
	read the record (via normal DMF mechanisms).

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message printed during the check/patch operation.

 Recommendation:
	If this is a check operation, the user must decide whether or not to
	patch. If the user patches, the user will lose the data for this tuple,
	and the user has no option at this point.


W_DM5006_BAD_ATTRIBUTE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - attribute number
	%1d - page number
	%2d - line number

 Explanation:
	The data contained for this attribute is not legal for the attribute
	type.  Example, a '\0' in a text string.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message printed during the check/patch operation.

 Recommendation:
	If this is a check operation, the user must decide whether or not to
	patch. If the user patches, then the user will lose the data for this
	attribute, and possibly the whole tuple.


W_DM5007_ADF_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0x - adf error number
	%1d - attribute number
	%2d - page number
	%3d - line number

 Explanation:
	Either adc_valchk() or adc_getempty() returned an unexpected error.
	These routines are called by dm1u_datapg when checking tuples on a
	data page.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message; processing starts on the next attribute.

 Recommendation:
	Check/patch will not operate on the tuple if there are unexpected ADF
	errors.  The user may want to restart the server and rerun patch later.


W_DM5008_TOO_MANY_BAD_ATTS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - line number

 Explanation
	The check/patch operation checks each attribute of each tuple to see
	if the data contained there is valid for the attribute type.  If it
	finds more than a single bad attribute in a tuple, then it simply
	makes the assumption that the whole tuple is corrupted.

 System Status;
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	If the user is running check, they must decide whether or not to run
	patch.  If they run patch, they will lose the contents of this tuple.


W_DM5009_MERGED_DATA_CHAIN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation
	The check table patch operation has found a data page (or overflow data
	page) that is referenced more than once.  This is an error condition,
	which will cause incorrect values to be retrieved from the table.
	(When there is a merged chain, there are usually orphan pages in the
	file as well.  An orphan page is a page that is not referenced at all,
	and the DBMS server never sees values on an orphan page.)

 System Status;
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM500A_CIRCULAR_DATA_CHAIN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The check table patch operation has found a data page (or overflow data
	page) that is referenced more than once.  This is an error condition,
	which will cause incorrect values to be retrieved from the table.
	(When there is a circular chain, the server will get caught in an
	endless loop while walking that chain and will not return from some
	queries.)

 System Status;
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM500B_WRONG_PAGE_MAIN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - value page_main should have
	%2d - actual value of page_main

 Explanation:
	Each data page has a page_main that DMF will use to determine what main
	page to go to next while walking a file.  The interpretation of
	page_main varies depending on file storage structure.  However, it is
	necessary for page_main to be correct, and it is not.

 System Status;
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM500C_ORPHAN_DATA_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The specified data page is not referenced.  This means that the data on
	this page, or on any overflow pages chained to this page, is lost.  The
	server will never see the data because the page is not referenced.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM500D_WRONG_PAGE_OVFL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - actual value page_ovfl

 Explanation:
	Each data page has a page_ovfl that DMF will use to search overflow
	data pages.  However, overflow data pages are NOT allowed in btrees.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM500E_UNKNOWN_BTREE_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1x - value of page->page_stat

 Explanation:
	The page_stat field of a page is used to determine what type of page
	this is.  This page is not marked as anything that is legal for a
	btree table.  This may or may not cause problems for DMF, depending on
	what type of page this really is.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM500F_BAD_FREE_LIST_HDR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Page 1 is the btree free page list header page. It is used to determine
	where to go to get a free page.  If there are not any free pages, then
	new memory is allocated and chained to this page.  It is very serious
	if DMF cannot read this page.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5010_BAD_HDR_PAGE_STAT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Page 1 is the btree free page list header page. It is used to determine
	where to go to get a free page.  The page_stat for this page should be
	set to DMPP_INDEX, and it is not.  This is probably not a serious
	error (if this is all that is wrong with the file), as DMF will not
	check the page_stat for this page.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user may run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5011_ILLEGAL_DATA_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number of data page

 Explanation:
	This page indicates that it is a data page.  However, iirelation
	indicates that this table is really a btree secondary index.  Btree
	secondary index tables do not contain data pages.  Instead, the leaf
	pages reference data pages in the main file.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5012_NO_FREE_PAGES:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	All btree files have a free-list header page, which contains a chain of
	free pages currently in the file.  It is possible that there are not
	any free pages in the file.  However, it is also possible that there
	are free pages and that the free-list header is corrupted. If there are
	not any messages about unreferenced free pages, then the first case is
	what occurred.  Otherwise, it is the latter.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user may run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5013_CIRCULAR_FREE_LIST:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number of free page

 Explanation:
	The free-list chain is corrupted.  Each page on the free-list should
	be referenced only once.  This page is referenced twice.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5014_FREE_PAGE_UNREADABLE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number of free page

 Explanation:
	The free-list chain is corrupted.  Each page on the free-list should
	reference another page on the free-page chain (except for the end of
	chain page).  In this case, the free-page is unreadable, so it is not
	possible to follow the chain any further.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5015_FREE_PAGE_UNKNOWN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number of free page

 Explanation:
	The free-list chain is corrupted.  Each page on the free-list should
	reference another page on the free-page chain (except for the end of
	chain page).  In this case, this page in the free-page chain is not
	marked as a free page.  Actually, the page type is not marked at all.
	It is not possible to follow the chain any further.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5016_NOT_A_FREE_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number of free page

 Explanation:
	The free-list chain is corrupted.  Each page on the free-list should
	reference another page on the free-page chain (except for the end of
	chain page).  In this case, this page in the free-page chain is not
	marked as a free page, so it should not be in the free-page chain. It
	is not possible to follow the free-page chain any further.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5017_NO_1ST_LEAF:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The leftmost btree leaf page should be marked as bt_sequence[-2] != 0.
	That is how the check table operation finds the leftmost btree leaf
	page.  It needs to know that information to verify that the leaf
	sideways pointers (bt_nextpage) are correct.  In this case, the portion
	of dm1u() that checks the leaf pages was unable to find the leftmost
	leaf page, so dm1u_btree() cannot check the leaf sideways pointers. This
	indicates an unhealthy btree table.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5018_LEAF_CHAIN_BROKEN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - leaf page number in sideways leaf chain

 Explanation:
	One of the pages in the btree leaf-page chain (bt_nextpage) is not
	a leaf page, or is a page that cannot be read from disk.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5019_LEAF_CHAIN_DUPLICATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number in sideways leaf chain (4=> 4th page in chain)

 Explanation:
	One of the pages in the btree leaf-page chain (bt_nextpage) has been
	referenced in that chain more than once, or is a leaf page that was not
	referenced by any of the index pages.  This is an error condition, and
	the btree should be patched.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM501A_BAD_LINK_IN_CHAIN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number of next leaf page in sideways leaf chain

 Explanation:
	The leaf page sideways pointer on the specified page is larger than
	the number of pages in the file.  This means that the chain is
	corrupt.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM501B_UNREF_LEAF_FROM_CHAIN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - number of unreferenced leaf pages

 Explanation:
	Every leaf page in the file should be referenced precisely once via
	leaf page sideways pointers. In this case, some pages are unreferenced.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM501C_REFERENCED_BTREE_ROOT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The btree root page, page 0, is the top of the tree.  No btree leaf or
	index pages should ever point up the tree to this page.  However, in
	this case, either an index or leaf page has the root page for one of
	its BIDs/TIDs.  This indicates severe structural damage.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM501D_REFERENCED_FREEHDR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The btree free-list header page, page 1, is not in the chain to data
	pages, and therefore no btree leaf or index pages should ever point to
	this page. In this case, either an index or leaf page has the free-list
	header page for one of its BIDs/TIDs.  This indicates severe structural
	damage to the btree.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM501E_UNEXAMINED_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This should not be possible.  The check table operation checks every
	page in the file, so there is probably memory corruption in the
	dm1u_cb, which is allocated during dm1u_table() execution.  If the user
	sees this message, then the user may want to bring down the server,
	restart it, and rerun the check table operation.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should be critical of check table results if check table
	issues this message.  It is probably indicative of memory corruption.
	The user should bring down the server, restart it, then reissue
	the check table command.  If the user still gets this message, the user
	should call Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


W_DM501F_ORPHAN_BTREE_DATA_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This page is an orphan (i.e., is not referenced by any other pages in
	the btree table.)  This indicates an unhealthy situation that results
	in data loss.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5020_ORPHAN_BTREE_FREE_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This page is an orphan (i.e., is not referenced by any other pages in
	the btree table.)  This indicates an unhealthy situation.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5021_ORPHAN_BTREE_LEAF_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This page is an orphan (i.e., is not referenced by any other pages in
	the btree table.)  This indicates an unhealthy situation that results
	in data loss.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5022_ORPHAN_BTREE_OVFL_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This page is an orphan (i.e., is not referenced by any other pages in
	the btree table.)  This indicates an unhealthy situation that results
	in data loss.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5023_ORPHAN_BTREE_INDEX:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This page is an orphan (i.e., is not referenced by any other pages in
	the btree table.)  This indicates an unhealthy situation that results
	in data loss.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5024_ORPHAN_UNREADABLE_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This page is an orphan (i.e., is not referenced by any other pages in
	the btree table.)  It is also a page that DMF could not read from disk.
	It probably does not hurt that this page could not be read from disk
	since DMF will not use it.  (OF COURSE, THERE IS THE CHANCE THAT THIS
	PAGE IS A LEAF PAGE THAT WILL BE POINTED TO BY THE LEAF PAGE SIDEWAYS
	POINTERS.  HOWEVER, THAT WOULD BE AN ERROR CONDITON, AS ALL LEAF PAGES
	SHOULD BE REFERENCED BY INDEX PAGES.)  The user should probably patch
	the table to be safe.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5025_ORPHAN_ILLEGAL_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This page is an orphan (i.e., is not referenced by any other pages in
	the btree table.)  It is also an invalid page, because it does not
	identify what type of page it is.  This means that DMF would not know
	what to do with it. It probably does not hurt that this page is illegal
	since DMF will not use it.  (OF COURSE, THERE IS THE CHANCE THAT THIS
	PAGE IS A LEAF PAGE THAT WILL BE POINTED TO BY THE LEAF PAGE SIDEWAYS
	POINTERS.  HOWEVER, THAT WOULD BE AN ERROR CONDITON, AS ALL LEAF PAGES
	SHOULD BE REFERENCED BY INDEX PAGES.)  The user should probably patch
	the table to be safe.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5026_IDX_CHAIN_BROKEN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The index page tree structure is damaged.  This means that some/all of
	the leaf and data pages could not be referenced by following the tree.
	THIS IS VERY SERIOUS.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5027_NOT_INDEX_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This page is expected to be a btree index page.  It should either be
	the root page, or an index page referenced by another index page in
	the tree.  However, this page is not marked as an index page.  So,
	the check operation will have to assume it is not an index page, and
	must assume that the tree index structure is broken.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5028_MULT_REF_INDEX_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The btree index structure references each leaf and index page in the
	tree exactly once.  If a page is not referenced, that means that some
	of the data in the table is effectively lost.  If a page is referenced
	more than once, that means we will get undesired duplicate tuples.  (Of
	course, data pages may be referenced several times).

	In this case, an index page is referenced more than once.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5029_WRONG_BT_NEXTPAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - value of page->bt_nextpage

 Explanation:
	bt_nextpage is the leaf page forward pointer.  On leaf pages it is
	expected to contain the page number of a valid leaf page.  On index
	pages, it is expected to be equal to 0.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM502A_WRONG_BT_DATA:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - value of page->bt_data

 Explanation:
	bt_data is the associated data page pointer.  On leaf pages it is
	expected to contain the page number of a valid data page.  On index
	pages, it is expected to be equal to 0.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM502B_INVALID_BT_KIDS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - value of page->bt_kids
	%2d - DM1U_MAXBIDS

 Explanation:
	bt_kids indicates the number of BIDs on an index page or the number of
	TIDs on a leaf pages.  This must have a value between 0 and
	DM1U_MAXBIDS.  bt_kids is used to index into bt_sequence to get the
	offset to the BID/TID.  If the max index has an improper value, then
	how can we get data off of this page?

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM502C_BAD_BID_OFFSET:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - line number
	%1d - page number

 Explanation:
	To get a BID from an index page, one must first get the offset to the
	BID from bt_sequence.  In this case, the offset in bt_sequence is
	invalid. This is a corruption of the index chain, which means the table
	should be patched.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM502D_IDX_REFERENCES_SELF:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	The btree index structure references each leaf and index page in the
	tree exactly once.  If a page is not referenced, that means that some
	of the data in the table is effectively lost.   If a page is referenced
	more than once, that means we will get undesired duplicate tuples.  (Of
	course, data pages may be referenced several times).

	In this case, an index page references itself, which sets up an endless
	loop should DMF try to walk this tree.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM502E_IDX_REFERENCES_ROOT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	The btree index structure references each leaf and index page in the
	tree exactly once.  If a page is not referenced, that means that some
	of the data in the table is effectively lost.   If a page is referenced
	more than once, that means we will get undesired duplicate tuples.  (Of
	course, data pages may be referenced several times).

	In this case, this index page references the root index page, which
	sets up a large endless loop should DMF try to walk this tree.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM502F_IDX_REFERENCES_FREE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	The btree index structure references each leaf and index page in the
	tree exactly once.  If a page is not referenced, that means that some
	of the data in the table is effectively lost.   If a page is referenced
	more than once, that means we will get undesired duplicate tuples.  (Of
	course, data pages may be referenced several times).

	In this case, this index page references the free-list header, which
	means it will be treating a free page as an index page, which is
	meaningless.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5030_NOT_LEAF_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This page is expected to be a btree leaf page.  However, this page is
	not marked as a leaf page, so the check operation will have to
	assume it is not a leaf and must assume that the tree index
	structure is broken.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5031_MULT_REFERENCED_LEAF:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The check table patch operation has found a leaf page (or overflow leaf
	page) that is referenced more than once.  This is an error condition,
	which will cause incorrect values to be retrieved from the table.
	(The check table logic will attempt to distinguish between a merged and
	circular leaf-page chain if there was enough memory to allocate a
	dm1u_chain bitmap. If so, then either W_DM5032 or W_DM5033 will follow
	this error message.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5032_MERGED_LEAF_CHAIN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The check table patch operation has found a leaf page (or overflow leaf
	page) that is referenced more than once.  This is an error condition,
	which will cause incorrect values to be retrieved from the table.
	(When there is a merged chain, there are usually orphan pages in the
	file as well.  An orphan page is a page that is not referenced at all;
	the DBMS server never sees values on an orphan page.)

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5033_CIRCULAR_LEAF_CHAIN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The check table patch operation has found a leaf page (or overflow leaf
	page) that is referenced more than once.  This is an error condition,
	which will cause incorrect values to be retrieved from the table.
	(When there is a circular chain, the server will get caught in an
	endless loop while walking that chain and will not return from some
	queries.)

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5034_TOOMANY_NEG_INFINITY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - page number

 Explanation:
	A btree has one or more leaf pages.  The leaf page containing the
	smallest key (known as negative infinity) is marked by a nonzero TID
	on bt_sequence[DM1B_LRANGE].  The leaf page containing the largest key
	(known as positive infinity) is marked by a nonzero TID on
	bt_sequence[DM1B_RRANGE].  If the file contains only a single page,
	that page will be marked as both positive and negative infinity.
	Regardless of the number of pages in the file, only 1 leaf page should
	be marked as negative infinity, and only one should be marked as
	positive infinity.

	In this case, at least two pages were marked as negative infinity.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5035_TOOMANY_POS_INFINITY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - page number

 Explanation:
	A btree has one or more leaf pages.  The leaf page containing the
	smallest key (known as negative infinity), is marked by a nonzero TID
	on bt_sequence[DM1B_LRANGE].  The leaf page containing the largest key
	(known as positive infinity) is marked by a nonzero TID on
	bt_sequence[DM1B_RRANGE].  If the file contains only a single page,
	that page will be marked as both positive and negative infinity.
	Regardless of the number of pages in the file, only 1 leaf page should
	be marked as negative infinity, and only one should be marked as
	positive infinity.

	In this case, at least two pages were marked as positive infinity.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.

 Parameters:
	%0d - line number
	%1d - page number

 Explanation:
	Leaf pages contain TID/key pairs in lieu of data.  The bt_sequence
	array contains an offset of where on the page the TID/key pair
	resides.  Something was structurally wrong with the page, probably
	bt_sequence[] had an invalid value.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5037_NOT_LEAF_OVFL_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This page is expected to be a leaf overflow page. However, this page is
	not marked as an overflow page, so the check operation will have to
	assume it is not a leaf overflow and must assume that the tree index
	structure is broken.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5038_WRONG_BTNEXTPG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - overflow leaf page number

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM503A_BAD_OVFL_PG_KEY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - overflow leaf page number
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	The only reason for btree leaf overflow pages to exist is when there are
	more tuples in the table with the identical key than fit on a single
	leaf page, in which case a leaf overflow page is created.  The leaf
	overflow page must have the same key as the leaf page they overflowed
	from.  In this case, a different key was found on the leaf page.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM503B_BAD_OVFLPARENT_KEY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - leaf page number
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	The only reason for btree leaf overflow pages to exist is when there are
	more tuples in the table with the identical key than fit on a single
	leaf page, in which case a leaf overflow page is created.  The leaf
	overflow page must have the same key as the leaf page they overflowed
	from. In this case, the leaf page that overflows has more than 1 key
	value on it.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM503C_BAD_LEAF_KEY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - leaf page number
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	The keys on a leaf page must be in increasing order on the page.  (Of
	course, it is legal to have identical keys).  However, the keys must
	never be in decreasing order.  The key at the specified line is
	less than a preceding key on this page.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM503D_NO_SUCH_TID:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - leaf page number
	%1d - tid.page
	%2d - tid.line

 Explanation:
	The leaf page references a TID that does not exist in this file. That
	is the leaf page says to go to data page X, line Y to get the data,
	but there is no line Y on page X, or there is no page X. THIS IS THE
	MOST COMMON TYPE OF BTREE CORRUPTION.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM503E_FIXED_LEAF:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0x - address of fixed leaf page

 Explanation:
	dm1u_lchain expects() no pages fixed to dm1u_cb->dm1u_leaf_pg_ptr, but
	a page is fixed there, so it is skipping the checking of leaf page
	sideways pointers.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM503F_NOT_A_LEAF:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	We are walking the leaf page sideways pointers (bt_nextpage), so we
	expect this page to be a leaf page, but it is not.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5040_KEY_HOLE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - leaf page number

 Explanation:
	We are walking the leaf page sideways pointers (bt_nextpage).  The last
	key on one page should be identical to the first key on the next page.
	In this case, the keys did not match.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5041_MULTIREF_LEAFS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d -  number of unreferenced leaf pages

 Explanation:
	Every leaf page in the file should be referenced precisely once via
	leaf page sideways pointers.  In this case, some pages are referenced
	multiple times.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE SHOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE, SINCE CHECK
	LOGIC DETECTS CIRCULAR CHAINS AND STOPS, BUT THIS CONDITION IS HANDLED
	FOR COMPLETENESS.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5042_NOT_DATA_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The check operation has encountered a non-data page, referenced by
	a leaf page.  THIS IS A SERIOUS ERROR.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5043_LEAF_REFERENCES_SELF:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The check operation has encountered a leaf page with a page_ovfl that
	points to itself.  This means that if DMF tries to access this page,
	it will end up in an endless loop.  THIS IS A SERIOUS ERROR.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5044_IDX_CHAIN_BROKEN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The index page tree structure is damaged.  This means that some/all of
	the leaf and data pages could not be referenced by following the tree.
	THIS IS VERY SERIOUS.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5045_NOT_INDEX_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This page is expected to be an ISAM index page.  It should either be
	the root page, or an index page referenced by another index page in
	the tree.  However, this page is not marked as an index page, so
	the check operation will have to assume it is not an index page and
	must assume that the tree index structure is broken.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5046_MULT_REF_INDEX_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The ISAM index structure references each index page in the
	tree exactly once.  If a page is not referenced, that means that some
	of the data in the table is effectively lost.  If a page is referenced
	more than once, that means we will get undesired duplicate tuples.  (Of
	course, data pages may be referenced several times).

	In this case, an index page is referenced more than once.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5047_INVALID_NUM_KEYS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - value of page->page_next_line
	%2d - DM_TIDEOF

 Explanation:
	page_next_line indicates the number of keys on an index page.  This
	must have a value between 0 and DM_TIDEOF; page_next_line is used to
	index into page_line_tab to get the offset to the key.  If the maximum
	number of keys on page has an improper value, then how can we get
	get data off of this page?

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5048_INVALID_PAGE_OVFL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - value of page->page_ovfl
	%2d - DM_TIDEOF

 Explanation:
	page_ovfl indicates the page number of the data or index page containing
	the smallest key on this page.  If this is the lowest level index page
	(page_main=0), then this must point to a data page.  If this is a higher
	level index page (page_main >0), then this must indicate an index page.
	Data pages must fall between 0 and iirelation.relprim-1.  Index pages
	must fall between iirelation.relprim and iirelation.relmain.

	In this case, this is the lowest level index page, so we expect
	page_ovfl to indicate a data page, but it does not.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5049_INVALID_PAGE_OVFL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - value of page->page_ovfl

 Explanation:
	page_ovfl indicates the page number of the data or index page containing
	the smallest key on this page.  If this is the lowest level index page
	(page_main=0), then this must point to a data page.  If this is a higher
	level index page (page_main >0), then this must indicate an index page.
	Data pages must fall between 0 and iirelation.relprim-1.  Index pages
	must fall between iirelation.relprim and iirelation.relmain.

	In this case, this is a higher level index page, so we expect
	page_ovfl to indicate an ISAM index page, but it does not.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM504A_MISSING_ISAM_KEY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - offset into page_line_tab where NULL offset resides

 Explanation:
	The ISAM index structure contains 1 or more keys on a page.  There
	should be page_next_line number of keys on the index page, and the
	page_line_tab should have a valid offset to each key.  Valid offsets
	are greater than zero and less than the page size.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM504B_IDX_REFERENCES_SELF:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	The ISAM index structure references each index page in the
	tree exactly once.  If a page is not referenced, that means that some
	of the data in the table is effectively lost.  If a page is referenced
	more than once, that means we will get undesired duplicate tuples.  (Of
	course, data pages may be referenced several times).

	In this case, an index page references itself, which sets up an endless
	loop should DMF try to walk this tree.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM504C_IDX_REFERENCES_ROOT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	The ISAM index structure references each index page in the
	tree exactly once.  If a page is not referenced, that means that some
	of the data in the table is effectively lost.  If a page is referenced
	more than once, that means we will get undesired duplicate tuples.  (Of
	course, data pages may be referenced several times).

	In this case, this index page references the root index page, which
	sets up a large endless loop should DMF try to walk this tree.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM504D_INDEX_KEY_OFFSET:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The ISAM index page uses the same structure as a data page, except that
	the only "data" contained on the page is 1 or more keys.  Each key
	has an entry in page_line_tab indicating the offset to where on the
	data page the key is stored. The value in page_line_tab for one of the
	keys is either null or points past the end of the page.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM504E_WRONG_NUM_KEYS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The TCB reflects a disagreement between iirelation.relkeys (actual
	field is tcb_relatts) and the number of iiattribute attributes that
	describe the key (tcb_keys).  This could either reflect inconsistent
	DBMS catalogs or a DMF internal error.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the "verifydb dbms_catalogs" operation to assure
	that the DBMS catalogs are consistent.  If so, repeat the table check.
	If the same error occurs after verifying that catalogs are consistent,
	the user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM504F_KEYS_NOT_SEQUENTIAL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The TCB contains a copy of iiattribute records that describe the
	attributes in the key.  These DMP_ATTS records should be ordered by
	"key" in ascending order.  In this case they are not.  This could
	reflect inconsistent DBMS catalogs or could reflect a DMF internal
	error.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the "verifydb dbms_catalogs" operation to assure
	that the DBMS catalogs are consistent.  If so, repeat the table check.
	If the same error occurs after verifying that catalogs are consistent,
	the user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5050_BAD_ISAM_KEY_ORDER:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The keys on an ISAM index page should be in increasing order.  The
	check table utility found a page where they did not follow that order.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5051_MULTIREF_DATA_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The ISAM index page should only reference a data page once.  In this
	case, the page has been referenced more than once.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5052_BAD_PAGE_MAIN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - value of bad page_main.

 Explanation:
	ISAM main pages must fall between the range of:
	    0 <= page_main < iirelation.relmain
	However, this data page has a page_main that does not fall in this
	range.  This means that the next "data" page referenced is really an
	overflow page or an index page.  This is not a healthy condition.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5053_BAD_ISAM_OVFL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - value of bad page_ovfl

 Explanation:
	ISAM overflow pages come after the index pages in the file, and must be:
	        page_main > iirelation.relprim
	However, this data page has a page_ovfl that does not meet this
	condition.  This means that the overflow page referenced is really a
	data page or an index page.  This is not a healthy condition.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5054_MULTIREF_ISAM_OVFL_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The ISAM overflow chain should only reference an overflow page once.
	In this case, the page has been referenced more than once.  This means
	that we have a circular or merged chain.  Either case is VERY unhealthy.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5055_BAD_OVFL_PAGEMAIN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - value of expected page_main.

 Explanation:
	On an ISAM overflow page, the page_main should be the same value as
	the main page that this overflow page is chained to.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5056_ORPHAN_ISAM_MAIN_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The ISAM index structure starts at the root.  The root pages reference
	lower level index pages.  The lowest level index page references MAIN
	or data pages.  (It is legal for the root page to also be the lowest
	level index page.)  If there is not enough room on a data page to hold
	all tuples with keys in the key range for that page, then overflow
	pages are created and chained to the main page.  If the overflow page
	fills up, then an additional overflow page is chained to it.  Thus,
	index pages should reference lower level index pages or main data pages.
	Main data pages may only reference overflow pages, but will not
	always do so.  Overflow pages may only reference other overflow pages.

	In this case, there is a main data page that was not referenced by any
	ISAM index page.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5057_ORPHAN_ISAM_INDEX_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The ISAM index structure starts at the root.  The root pages reference
	lower level index pages.  The lowest level index page references MAIN
	or data pages.  (It is legal for the root page to also be the lowest
	level index page.)  If there is not enough room on a data page to hold
	all tuples with keys in the key range for that page, then overflow
	pages are created and chained to the main page.  If the overflow page
	fills up, then an additional overflow page is chained to it.  Thus,
	index pages should reference lower level index pages or main data pages.
	Main data pages may only reference overflow pages, but will not
	always do so.  Overflow pages may only reference other overflow pages.

	In this case, there is an index data page that was not referenced by any
	other ISAM index page.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5058_ORPHAN_ISAM_OVFL_PG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The ISAM index structure starts at the root.  The root pages reference
	lower level index pages.  The lowest level index page references MAIN
	or data pages.  (It is legal for the root page to also be the lowest
	level index page.)  If there is not enough room on a data page to hold
	all tuples with keys in the key range for that page, then overflow
	pages are created and chained to the main page.  If the overflow page
	fills up, then an additional overflow page is chained to it.  Thus,
	index pages should reference lower level index pages or main data pages.
	Main data pages may only reference overflow pages, but will not
	always do so.  Overflow pages may only reference other overflow pages.

	In this case, there is an overflow page that was not referenced by an
	isam data page or by any other ISAM overflow pages.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM5059_BAD_KEY_GET:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - leaf page number
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	The key at the specified line in the page could not be read. There
	may be structural damage to the page, the key may contain invalid
	data, or there may be an internal software problem.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run the patch table operation on this file.  The patch
	table operation will remove all secondary indexes and convert the table
	to heap.  Then the user may recreate secondary indexes and modify the
	table to the desired storage structure.


W_DM505A_CORRUPT_FHDR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - FHDR page number

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered while trying to verify a table's
	FHDR page. There should be previous errors in the error log
	describing in more detail what went wrong and what table/index
	is affected.

 System Status:
	The table/index in question cannot be accessed until the FHDR/FMAP(s)
	have been repaired.

 Recommendation:
	The only fully supported technique for resolving the problem is 
	to run rollforwarddb on the database.  

	If this is not possible, verifydb may be able to recover data so
	that the table can be recreated.


W_DM505B_CORRUPT_FMAP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - FMAP page number
	%1d - FMAP ID number within the FHDR

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered while trying to verify a table's
	FMAP page. There should be previous errors in the error log
	describing in more detail what went wrong and what table/index
	is affected.

 System Status:
	The table/index in question cannot be accessed until the FHDR/FMAP(s)
	have been repaired.

 Recommendation:
	The only fully supported technique for resolving the problem is 
	to run rollforwarddb on the database.  

	If this is not possible, verifydb may be able to recover data so
	that the table can be recreated.


W_DM505C_FMAP_INCONSISTENCY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - incorrect page number
	%1d - FMAP ID
	%2x - page status for the problem page

 Explanation:
	A page is marked as free in the FMAP, while the page's status indicates
	that the page is in use. This means that the page may be reused, and
	hence overwritten, leading to the loss of data.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The only fully supported technique for resolving the problem is 
	to run rollforwarddb on the database.  

	If this is not possible, verifydb may be able to recover data so
	that the table can be recreated.


W_DM505D_TOTAL_FMAP_INCONSIS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - total number of pages inconsistent with the FMAP(s)

 Explanation:
	There are this number of pages that are marked as free in the FMAP(s),
	but their page status indicates that they are in use. This means 
	that the pages may be reused, and hence overwritten, leading to the 
	loss of data.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The only fully supported technique for resolving the problem is 
	to run rollforwarddb on the database.  

	If this is not possible, verifydb may be able to recover data so
	that the table can be recreated.


W_DM505E_NO_ETAB_TABLE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - iirelation reltid index referenced in the coupon
	%1c - attribute name within the specified table of the
	      peripheral attribute
	%2d - Tuple ID (TID) of the tuple containing the bad coupon

 Explanation:
	The specified tuple contains a coupon that references an non-existent
	extension table, perhaps the table has been deleted.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The only fully supported technique for resolving the problem is 
	to run rollforwarddb on the database.  

	If this is not possible, verifydb may be able to recover data so
	that the coupon may be re-constructed.


W_DM505F_TOO_MANY_BAD_SEGS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - The number of contiguous segment numbers that were tried before
	      the check was abandoned

 Explanation:
	Verifydb was unable to find a contiguous segment after the specified
	number of tries, so the check for the current coupon was abandoned.
	This problem may be caused by corruption in the segments themselves
	which indicate whether that is another segment present, or may be
	caused by too many missing segments.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The only fully supported technique for resolving the problem is 
	to run rollforwarddb on the database or specified table.


W_DM5060_NO_ETAB_SEGMENT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - segment number of missing segment
	%1d - Extension table index value in iirelation (relid)
	%2c - Name of peripheral data-type field in the base table
	%3d - Tuple ID (TID) of the tuple containing coupon in the base table

 Explanation:
	The indicated segment could not be found in the specified extension
	table for the specified peripheral field in the specified record. This
	may be caused by corruption in the extension table, corruption in
	the previous extension segment, or the actual non-existence of the
	record in the extension table.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The only fully supported technique for resolving the problem is 
	to run rollforwarddb on the database or table.  



W_DM5061_WRONG_BLOB_LENGTH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - attribute name 
	%1d - base table tuple ID of offending tuple
	%2s - length or peripheral record as stated in the coupon
	%3d - actual length of the peripheral record in the extension table

 Explanation:
	The indicated field in the record with the indicated tuple ID contains
	a peripheral coupon that has a stipulated length that is different
	from the combined length of all of it's segments in the extension
	table.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
	The only fully supported technique for resolving the problem is 
	to run rollforwarddb on the database or table.  



W_DM5062_INVALID_INDEX_KPERPAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c - table name
      %1c - table owner
	%2d - page number
	%3d - number of index entries this page was formatted with
	%4d - Computed value of index keys per page

 Explanation:
      The values of index keys per page computed by the server should always
      match the number of entries the index page was formatted with.

 System Status;
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
      Contact your Ingres Corporation Technical Support representative.


W_DM5063_INVALID_LEAF_KPERPAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c - table name
      %1c - table owner
	%2d - page number
	%3d - number of leaf entries this page was formatted with
	%4d - Computed value of leaf keys per page

 Explanation:
      The values of leaf keys per page computed by the server should always
      match the number of entries the leaf page was formatted with.

 System Status;
	This is a diagnostic message.

 Recommendation:
      Contact your Ingres Corporation Technical Support representative.


W_DM5064_BAD_ATTRIBUTE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - attribute number
	%1d - page number
	%2d - line number
	%3c - Associated message text.

 Explanation:
	The data contained for this attribute is not legal for the attribute
	type.  Example, a '\0' in a text string.

 System Status:
	This is a diagnostic message printed during the check/patch operation.

 Recommendation:
	If this is a check operation, the user must decide whether or not to
	patch. If the user patches, then the user will lose the data for this
	attribute, and possibly the whole tuple.


W_DM51FB_NO_CHAIN_MAP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Check table keeps a bitmap indicating which pages have been referenced
	this particular pass (i.e., while walking a specific overflow chain,
	etc.).  When it tried to allocate this bit map, it got an error, so it
	will continue processing, but skip any logic that requires this bitmap.

 System Status:
	Processing continues, but if a page is referenced more than once, it
	will not be able to distinguish whether this is a circular chain or a
	merged chain.

 Recommendation:
	The user probably won't care if this is a circular or merged chain. The
	fact that the index or overflow chain is damaged is enough to merit
	patching the table.


W_DM51FC_ERROR_PUTTING_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	DMF was able to successfully read the page from disk via
	dm0p_fix_page().  However, it was not able to put the page back
	via dm0p_unfix_page().  This type of error should not occur unless
	the page cache is corrupted.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user should check the error log to see why the page could not be
	unfixed.


W_DM51FD_TOO_MANY_BAD_PAGES:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	There was an error reading a page into memory via dm0p_fix_page(). This
	occurred for more than 1/2 of the pages in the file, so the patch/check
	operation is giving up on this file.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user cannot recover this table -- it is too far gone.


W_DM51FE_CANT_READ_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	Each page of the open file is read in via dm0p_fix_page().  This is
	a normal DMF method for obtaining pages from an open file.  Since DMF
	cannot read the page, the check/patch operation cannot operate on this
	page.

 System Status:
	Processing continues -- it tries to go on to the next page.

 Recommendation:
	The only fully supported technique for resolving the problem is 
	to run rollforwarddb on the database.  

	If this is not possible, verifydb may be able to recover data so
	that the table can be recreated.


W_DM51FF_BAD_RELSPEC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The check operation uses a different check algorithm for each storage
	structure: TCB_HEAP (3), TCB_HASH (7), TCB_ISAM (5) and TCB_BTREE(11).
	The value of iirelation.relspec is none of the above.

 System Status:
	The check operation statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user should set iirelation.relspec to the correct value.  If the
	user does not know what storage structure the table is, they cannot
	check it.  However, they can still patch it, which will convert it to
	heap and remove all secondary indexes.


I_DM5201_BAD_PG_NUMBER:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - real page number
	%1d - erroneous page number that appeared on page

 Explanation:
	The page_page field contains the page number in the file.  In this
	case, the page number is incorrect on the data page.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message printed during the check/patch
	operation.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM5202_FIXED_DATA_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	Either page_next_line was invalid, was incorrect, or did not agree with
	the values in page_line_tab.  Therefore, page_next_line was reassigned
	to a valid/correct value.  This means that page_line_tab was healthy,
	or such a correction would not be possible.  When a page is structurally
	patched, it is marked as page_stat = DMPP_FIXED.  If the strict
	algorithm is run on this page before the file is modified to another
	storage structure, then all tuples on this page will be thrown away.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message printed during the check/patch
	operation.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM5204_STRUCTURAL_DAMAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	All information on this page has been thrown away.  The page has been
	reformatted as an empty data page, and may be resued at some future
	date.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message printed during the check/patch
	operation.

 Recommendation:
	None.


W_DM5205_INVALID_TID:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	The check/patch operation has already verified that the page is
	structurally sound.  However, for some reason, it was unable to
	read the record (via normal DMF mechanisms).  Therefore, it cleared
	the TID.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM5206_BAD_ATTRIBUTE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - attribute number
	%1d - page number
	%2d - line number

 Explanation:
	The data contained for this attribute is not legal for the attribute
	type.  For example, a '\0' in a text string.  This data has been set to
	whatever the correct empty value is for the data type.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message.

 Recommendation:
	None.


W_DM5208_TOO_MANY_BAD_ATTS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	The check/patch operation checks each attribute of each tuple to see
	if the data contained there is valid for the attribute type.  If it
	finds more than a single bad attribute in a tuple, it makes the
	assumption that the whole tuple is corrupted, so it deletes
	the offending tuple from the page.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM5209_FREE_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This message identifies which btree page is being processed and
	what type of page it is.

 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This messages identifies which btree page is being examined and
	that it is an index page.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM5210_CHECK_BINDEX:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	Check table walks the table twice for btrees.  The first pass 
	identifies which type of page each page is, and also checks free and
	data pages.  The second pass checks index and leaf pages.  Since these
	pages are identified much earlier than they are processed, an
	informational message is output when it is time to process the
	index page.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM5211_NUM_BTREE_PAGES:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - the number of pages in the btree table's file.

 Explanation:
	This message identifies the number of pages in the file.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM5212_STARTING_BORPHAN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Btree processing is complex and multipass.  This message is intended to
	let the user know where they are in the check table process:
	  a) read in each page and identify page type (also check free/data
	     pages)
	  b) check free-page list header and free-list chain.
	  c) check btree index/leaf/overflow pages
	  d) check for orphans
	  e) check leaf page sideways pointers
	Check table is starting step D.

 System Status:

 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Btree processing is complex and multipass.  This message is intended to
	let the user know where they are in the check table process:
	  a) read in each page and identify page type (also check free/data
	     pages)
	  b) check free page list header and free list chain.
	  c) check btree index/leaf/overflow pages
	  d) check for orphans
	  e) check leaf page sideways pointers.
	Check table is starting step E.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM5214_UNABLE_TO_CK_ORPHANS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Normally, check table detects unreferenced pages and processes them.
	It uses a bitmap to do this.  In this case, patch table was not able to
	allocate memory (1 bit per page for btree, 2 bits/page for hash/heap).

 System Status:
	This is an informational message printed during the check/patch
	operation.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to reconfigure the system to provide more memory for
	the server. If there were other diagnostic messages, the user may want
	to patch the table instead.  (Patching the table takes much less memory
	than checking it.)


I_DM5215_EMPTY_LEAF:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d  - page number

 Explanation:
	This leaf page is empty.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message printed during the check/patch
	operation.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to run modify to merge on this btree, if it turns out
	to be healthy but has a lot of empty leaf pages.


I_DM5216_EMPTY_LEAF_OVFL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d  - page number

 Explanation:
	This leaf page is empty.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message printed during the check/patch
	operation.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to run modify to merge on this btree, if it turns out
	to be healthy but has a lot of empty leaf pages.


I_DM5220_CHECK_IINDEX:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	This identifies which ISAM page is being examined and that it is
	an index page.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM5221_NUM_ISAM_PAGES:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - number of pages in the ISAM table's file

 Explanation:
	This message identifies the number of pages in the file.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM5222_STARTING_IORPHAN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	First check table attempts to walk the index chain, starting at the
	root page and going all the way down to the data pages.  Each time
	check table references a page, it sets a bit in a bitmap indicating
	that it has seen that page.  If the index chain is fully intact, then
	all pages in the file have been visited.  This message informs the
	user that check table is now checking the bitmap to assure that
	all pages in the file have been visited.  If it finds any unvisited
	pages, it will call the appropriate routine to check them.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM53F9_FMAP_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - FMAP page number

 Explanation:
	The check or patch operation has encountered a FMAP page.  It will
	check that the page is readable and that all pages that are marked
	as free in the FMAP also have a page status indicating that they are
	free.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message printed during the check/patch
	operation.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM53FA_FHDR_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - FHDR page number

 Explanation:
	The check or patch operation has encountered a FHDR page.  It will
	only check that the page is readable.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message printed during the check/patch
	operation.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM53FB_CHECK_DONE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The patch operation has completed.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message printed during the check/patch
	operation.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM53FC_PATCH_DONE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The patch operation has completed.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message printed during the check/patch
	operation.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM53FD_NOT_DATA_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The patch operation has encountered a non-data page.  It will convert
	that page to an empty data page, throwing away anything that is
	currently on the page.  This is a normal operation. (Patch throws
	away btree and ISAM index pages.)

 System Status:
	This is an informational message printed during the check/patch
	operation.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DM53FE_DATA_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number

 Explanation:
	The check or patch operation has encountered a data page.  It will
	check the page for structural and data errors.  If any are encountered,
	it will report the error and possibly throw away some/all tuples on
	the page (depending on the specified operation).

 System Status:
	This is an informational message printed during the check/patch
	operation.

 Recommendation:
	None.


W_DM5400_DIOPEN_ERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 W_DM5400_DIOPEN_ERR
 Parameters:
	%0c - filename
	%1c - directory pathname

 Explanation:
	A routine subordinate to dmm_finddbs() was attempting to do a DIopen()
	call, which is how DMF opens a file.  The file open failed in a
	manner that was unanticipated.  This is NOT due to the file NOT
	existing, as the code is set up to handle that error should it occur.

 System Status:
	This will be logged as a warning.  No further finddbs work will be
	done on the database associated with this directory, but the DMF portion
	of finddbs will continue on to the next directory.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to look at the directory and file for invalid
	protections, locked file, disk corruption, etc.  If the user finds
	and corrects a problem with the file, the user may want to re-run
	finddbs.


W_DM5401_LOC_DOESNOT_EXIST:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - directory pathname
	%1c - logical name of location that maps to this directory

 Explanation:
	The DMF finddbs logic was attempting to list all subdirectories in
	the data directory for a specified location.  It accomplishes
	this by searching the location parent directory (%0c) for
	subdirectories.  Each subdirectory that it finds is probably a database.
	However, an error was encountered when attempting to search the location
	parent directory.  The error status indicates that the search directory
	does not exist of there is a syntax error in how it is specified.

 System Status:
	This will be logged as a warning.  No further finddbs work will be
	done this location.  However, this warning will not prevent other
	locations from being searched.

 Recommendation:
	The user should verify that the location is correctly mapped, that the
	directory it is mapped to really exists, and the disk device containing
	it is online. The user may also want to verify that protections on this
	directory are correct.  If the user finds and corrects a problem with
	the directory, the user may want to re-run finddbs.


W_DM5402_UNEXPECTED_LISTDIR_ERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - logical name of location
	%1c - pathname that location maps to

 Explanation:
	The DMF finddbs logic was attempting to list all subdirectories in
	the data directory for a specified location.  It accomplishes
	this by searching the location parent directory (%1c) for
	subdirectories.  Each subdirectory that it finds is probably a database.
	However, an unexpected error was encountered during this search.  The
	DIlistdir() CL routine has detected this error and has decided to stop
	its search.

 System Status:
	This will be logged as a warning.  No further finddbs work will be
	done this location.  However, this warning will not prevent other
	locations from being searched.

 Recommendation:
	The user should verify that the location is correctly mapped, that the
	directory it is mapped to really exists, and the disk device containing
	it is online. The user may also want to verify that protections on this
	directory and on its subdirectories are correct.  If the user finds and
	corrects a problem with this location, the user may want to re-run
	finddbs..


W_DM5403_ADMIN_READ_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - logical name of location

 Explanation:
	DMF opened the admin30 (or oldadmin30) file of the unconverted
	v5.0 database successfully, but had problems reading information
	from that file. This means that finddbs could NOT obtain the
	information necessary to put this database into the installation
	definition tables.

 System Status:
	This will be logged as a warning.  No further finddbs work will be
	done this unconverted database.  However, this warning will not
	prevent other databases in this location from being searched/handled.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to look at the unconverted database to see why the
	admin30 file is unreadable.  The user may want to restore the admin30
	file from backup tape and re-run finddbs.


W_DM5404_BAD_JNL_LOC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - logical name of location

 Explanation:
	DMF opened the admin30 (or oldadmin30) file of the unconverted
	v5.0 database successfully, but was unable to translate the journal
	area to a v6 location name.  This means that finddbs could NOT obtain
	the information necessary to put this database into the installation
	definition tables.

 System Status:
	This will be logged as a warning.  No further finddbs work will be
	done this unconverted database.  However, this warning will not
	prevent other databases in this location from being searched/handled.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to look at the locations defined for v5 and locations
	defined for v6 and assure that they are compatible.


W_DM5405_BAD_CKP_LOC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - logical name of location

 Explanation:
	DMF opened the admin30 (or oldadmin30) file of the unconverted
	v5.0 database successfully, but was unable to translate the checkpoint
	area to a v6 location name.  This means that finddbs could NOT obtain
	the information necessary to put this database into the installation
	definition tables.

 System Status:
	This will be logged as a warning.  No further finddbs work will be
	done this unconverted database.  However, this warning will not
	prevent other databases in this location from being searched/handled.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to look at the locations defined for v5 and locations
	defined for v6 and assure that they are compatible.


W_DM5406_CANT_TRANSLATE_UCODE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - logical name of location
	%2c - 2-letter owner code

 Explanation:
	DMF opened the admin30 (or oldadmin30) file of the unconverted
	v5.0 database successfully, but was unable to translate the
	two-letter owner code to a v6 owner name.  This can be caused if
	the installation does not have an iicodemap table.  It can also be
	caused if the installation has an iicodemap table, and the user code
	is not listed in it.

 System Status:
	This will be logged as a warning.  This database will be added to
	the installation, but the owner name will be "UNKNOWN", which will
	effectively leave the database without a DBA and possibly unusable.

 Recommendation:
	The user should connect to the iidbdb and update iidatabase.own to a
	valid v6 user name, which will become the DBA once the database is
	converted.


W_DM5407_NO_V6_LOCATION:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - full pathname of journal/checkpoint location for unconverted v5
	        database

 Explanation:
	The admin30 file contains a pathname to a journal and checkpoint
	location rather than the journal and checkpoint location names, so
	finddbs attempted to match the pathname to a tuple in iitemp_locations
	(finddbs' work copy of iilocations) and could not find it.

 System Status:
	This will be logged as a warning.  Finddbs will not add this unconverted
	database to the installation definition catalogs, because it does not
	know how to define the journal or checkpoint location. However, finddbs
	will continue on to any other databases in the specified search
	location.

 Recommendation:
	The user should clean up definition logicals so that finddbs is not
	confused.  This may require defining a missing location or resolving
	two different locations that have the identical AREA.  Work should
	be done on catalog iilocations via accessdb.


W_DM5408_MULTIPLE_V6_LOCATIONS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - full pathname of journal/checkpoint location for unconverted v5
	        database

 Explanation:
	The admin30 file contains a pathname to a journal and checkpoint
	location rather than the journal and checkpoint location names, so
	finddbs attempted to match the pathname to a tuple in iitemp_locations
	(finddbs' work copy of iilocations) and found more than 1 tuple that
	matched.  Finddbs does not know which location name to use, so it
	cannot add this database to the installation.

 System Status:
	This will be logged as a warning.  Finddbs will not add this unconverted
	database to the installation definition catalogs, because it does not
	know how to define the journal or checkpoint location. However, finddbs
	will continue on to any other databases in the specified search
	location.

 Recommendation:
	The user should clean up definition logicals so that finddbs is not
	confused.  This may require defining a missing location or resolving
	two different locations that have the identical AREA.  Work should
	be done on catalog iilocations via accessdb.


W_DM5409_CONFIG_READ_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - logical name of location

 Explanation:
	DMF opened the config file (or recovery config file) of a database
	successfully, but had problems reading information from that file.
	This means that finddbs could NOT obtain the information necessary to
	put this database into the installation definition tables.

 System Status:
	This will be logged as a warning.  No further finddbs work will be
	done this database.  However, this warning will not prevent other
	databases in this location from being searched/handled.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to look at the database to see why the config file
	is unreadable.  The user may want to restore the config file from
	backup tape and re-run finddbs.


W_DM540A_LOC_NOT_DEFINED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - logical name of location

 Explanation:
	The config file contains this location, but it is not in iilocations
	(or iitemp_locations).

 System Status:
	This will be logged as a warning, but finddbs will continue processing
	this database.

 Recommendation:
	The user should note this warning and use accessdb to define the
	location for this installation. The user may check the iidatabase (or
	iiphys_database) tuple to see what type of location this is.  If the
	location is not listed in iiphys_database, check iiphys_extend and
	it will be an extended location.


E_DM5410_CLOSE_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database directory name
	%1c - directory pathname
	%2c - pathname to the location directory where database directory exists
	%3c - filename

 Explanation:
	A routine subordinate to dmm_finddbs() was attempting to do a DIclose()
	call, which is how DMF closes an open file. The file close failed, which
	is a very serious error.  We should always be able to close an open
	file and cannot afford to have extra open files hanging around using up
	resources.

 System Status:
	This will cause the server to shut down.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to look at the directory and file for invalid
	protections, locked file, disk corruption, etc.  If the user finds
	and corrects a problem with the file, the user may want to re-run
	finddbs, after they have restarted the server.


E_DM5411_ERROR_SEARCHING_LOC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - location name
	%1c - pathname that the location maps to

 Explanation:
	The DMM finddbs logic attempts to be fault tolerant.  However, certain
	types of errors will cause the internal procedure to be aborted.  Each
	of these errors will print a message either in the error log or to the
	front-end, explaining what went wrong.  In either case, the user should
	take the corrective action associated with that message.  This message
	is for information purposes only.

 System Status:
	The internal procedure statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	None for this message.  However, the user may want to take the
	corrective action associated with the message that indicates why
	the internal procedure is being aborted.


E_DM5412_IIPHYSDB_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The DMM finddbs inserts 1 or more tuples into work tables
	iiphys_database and iiphys_extend for each database that it finds.
	Some internal error prevented finddbs from inserting a tuple into
	iiphys_database.

 System Status:
	The internal procedure statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	None for this message.  However, the user may want to take the
	corrective action associated with the message that indicates why
	the internal procedure is being aborted.


E_DM5413_IIPHYSEXT_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The DMM finddbs inserts 1 or more tuples into work tables
	iiphys_database and iiphys_extend for each database that it finds.
	Some internal error prevented finddbs from inserting a tuple into
	iiphys_extend.

 System Status:
	The internal procedure statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	None for this message.  However, the user may want to take the
	corrective action associated with the message that indicates why
	the internal procedure is being aborted.


E_DM5414_ADMIN30_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - directory pathname
	%2c - pathname to the location directory where database directory exists

 Explanation:
	There was a failure while attempting to read data from admin30 for an
	unconverted database.

 System Status:
	This will cause the statement to be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to look at the directory and file for invalid
	protections, locked file, disk corruption, etc.  If the user finds and
	corrects a problem with the file, the user may want to re-run finddbs,
	after they have restarted the server.


E_DM5415_CONFIG_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - directory pathname
	%2c - pathname to the location directory where database directory exists

 Explanation:
	There was a failure while attempting to read data from the config
	file for this database.

 System Status:
	This will cause the statement to be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to look at the directory and file for invalid
	protections, locked file, disk corruption, etc.  If the user finds
	and corrects a problem with the file, the user may want to re-run
	finddbs, after they have restarted the server.


I_DM5420_DB_FOUND:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - location name

 Explanation:
	This is an informational message that a database was found.

 System Status:
	All processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	No action is required.  However, the user should probably watch the
	messages of databases found and take note of any that he did not really
	want in the installation.

	If several databases really belonging to another installation are found
	for this installation, this is a good indication that the iilocations
	catalog (or possibly ii_config:loc.bin) has bad information in it.
	The user should clean up locations via TM (call Ingres Corporation 
	Technical Support for information or instructions), delete 
	ii_config:loc.bin, then rerun finddbs. (WARNING: do not delete 
	loc.bin unless you have run finddbs in replace mode at least once, 
	or you may lose information about some of your database locations 
	in the installation.


I_DM5421_50DB_FOUND:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - location name

 Explanation:
	This is an informational message that an unconverted 5.0 database was
	found.

 System Status:
	All processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	No action is required.  However, the user should probably watch the
	messages of databases found and take note of any that he did not really
	want in the installation.

	If several databases really belonging to another installation are found
	for this installation, this is a good indication that the iilocations
	catalog (or possibly ii_config:loc.bin) has bad information in it.
	The user should clean up locations via TM (call Ingres Corporation 
	Technical Support for information or instructions), delete 
	ii_config:loc.bin, then rerun finddbs. (WARNING: do not delete loc.bin 
	unless you have run finddbs in replace mode at least once, or you 
	may lose information about some of your database locations in the 
	installation.


W_DM5422_IIDBDB_NOT_JOURNALED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
	We recommend that the iidbdb be journaled.  Journaling the iidbdb
	ensures that users will be able to recover the iidbdb if it should
	become damaged.  If the iidbdb is not journaled, there is a danger 
	that crucial installation information could be lost.  Therefore, we
	strongly recommend that journaling be enabled on the iidbdb.

 System Status:
	This message will be logged as a warning, but users will be allowed
	into the iidbdb.  This message is logged whenever any user enters the
	iidbdb and journaling is not enabled on it.

 Recommendation:
	We recommend that journaling be enabled on the iidbdb.  To do this,
	use the "ckpdb +j iidbdb" command.  See the ckpdb documentation for
	further information.

E_DM902D_BAD_JNL_READ:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM902E_BAD_JNL_WRITE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1d - journal file sequence number
	%2d - journal file block number

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered in the routine which writes to
	the journal file.  The specific operating system error
	that created this condition should have been previously
	logged.

	This error is usually caused by the journal file filling up.

 System Status:
	The dmfacp will fail, which, if not restarted, will eventually
	cause the log file to fill.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for the specific reason for failure.  If the
	cause is the journal file filling up, the following sequence of
	operations are suggested:

	  1) Disable journaling via "alterdb -j <database>".

	  2) Either free up space on the disk on which the journal resides, or
	     relocate the journal location either through the use of symbolic
	     links (Unix), logical name reassignment (VMS), or, if the system
	     is down, by the modification of the journal location via accessdb.

	  3) Checkpoint the database via "ckpdb +j" to reenable journaling.

E_DM9035_BAD_JNL_TRUNCATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9036_JNLCKP_CREATE_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered in the routine which checks/creates
	subdirectories for the database in the journal, checkpoint, and
	dump locations.

	This is done when checkpointing a database.

	This error could be caused by the non-existence of some DBMS
	parent directory or the lack of definition of an environment 
	variable, such as II_JOURNAL, II_CHECKPOINT, or II_DUMP.

	This error should be preceded by an error message which should
	give more specific information about the error.

 System Status:
	The checkpoint operation will fail; the database state will remain
	unchanged.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for the specific reason for failure. When the error
	is corrected, re-execute the checkpoint command.


E_DM9037_BAD_JNL_CREATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered in the creation of a journal file.
	Journal files are created when a checkpoint of the database takes
	place, or when a prior journal file fills up.

	This problem can occur when an initial allocation amount has been
	specified by "alterdb -init_jnl_blocks", and there is insufficient
	space on the disk for the initial allocation.  Note that only the 
	first file created after a checkpoint is preallocated (subsequent 
	journal file creates ignore the "initial allocation").

	The problem may also be the result of quota or other operating
	system file-creation problems, or if required directories have
	been inadvertently removed.

	This error should be preceded by an error message which should
	give more specific information about the error.

 System Status:
	The archiver (dmfacp) will stop.  If lack of disk space is the cause
	of the problem, space should be freed prior to restarting the archiver.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for the specific reason for failure. When the error
	is corrected, re-execute the checkpoint command.


E_DM9040_BAD_CKP_DIRCREATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9041_LK_ESCALATE_TABLE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9042_PAGE_DEADLOCK:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0	Page number.   
	%1	Table name.              
	%2	Database name.   
	%3	Lock mode.                                
	%4	Pid & session id of (one) user that holds the desired resource.

 Explanation:
	A request for the indicated page lock, which was held by
	another user, would have caused a deadlock as you hold other
	resources that are being waited on by that user or other users
	waiting on that user. 

 System Status:
	Your transaction is being rolled back automatically.        

 Recommendation:
	The aborted transaction may be retried. If the problem persists you
	may use the session id provided in the message to track down
	who is holding the desired lock.
	You may recode applications that access common resources to
	follow protocols that will reduce the chance of causing deadlocks.


E_DM9043_LOCK_TIMEOUT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0	Table name.
	%1	Database name.  
	%2	Lock mode.       
	%3	Owner name, if available, else ?
	%4	Type of lock: 'ESCALATE', 'CONTROL', 'TABLE', 'PAGE nnnnn'.  
	%5	Pid & session id of (one) user that holds the desired resource.

 Explanation:
	When requesting the type of lock indicated, which was held by
	another user, the desired timeout interval expired. 

 System Status:
	Your session is no longer waiting for the lock, the current
	query has been interrupted. Your transaction is still active and
	can be committed or aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The current query may be retried. If the problem persists you may 
	use the session id provided in the message to track down
	who is holding the desired lock.


E_DM9044_ESCALATE_DEADLOCK:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9045_TABLE_DEADLOCK:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0	Table owner.   
	%1	Table name.              
	%2	Database name.   
	%3	Lock mode.                                
	%4	Pid & session id of (one) user that holds the desired resource.

 Explanation:
	A request for the indicated table lock, which was held by
	another user, would have caused a deadlock as you hold other
	resources that are being waited on by that user or other users
	waiting on that user. 

 System Status:
	Your transaction is being rolled back automatically.        

 Recommendation:
	The aborted transaction may be retried. If the problem persists you
	may use the session id provided in the message to track down
	who is holding the desired lock.
	You may recode applications that access common resources to
	follow protocols that will reduce the chance of causing deadlocks.

E_DM904F_ERROR_UNFIXING_PAGES:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9050_TRANSACTION_NOLOGGING:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	This message is logged whenever a user session executes the
	SET NOLOGGING statement.   It does not indicate an error, but
	points out the possibility for error.

	If a transaction running in this session fails, no recovery will
	be performed, and the database, while not listed as "inconsistent",
	will be left in an unknown state.

 System Status:
	No effect on the current session/transaction.

 Recommendation:
	The user should be careful when using SET NOLOGGING and make
	sure that any errors returned to the session are trapped and
	appropriate action taken.  The appropriate action to take following
	an error in SET NOLOGGING mode is to restore the database from a
	valid checkpoint.


E_DM9051_ABORT_NOLOGGING:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	A user session which had executed the SET NOLOGGING statement to
	bypass the logging system encountered an error while executing
	an update transaction.  Since no logging was performed for this
	transaction, no recovery could be done.

	The database has been left in an unknown state -- likely inconsistent.
	The database has not, however, been marked "inconsistent".  The user
	must restore the database using a valid checkpoint in order to
	regain data consistency.

 System Status:
	The database is left in an inconsistent state -- while not actually
	being marked "inconsistent".

 Recommendation:
	The user should restore the database using a valid checkpoint.


E_DM9052_WORK_PATH_INVALID:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - name of work path logical
	%1c - value of this logical

 Explanation:
	As the DBMS server starts up, it dereferences all the II_WORKDIR_xx_nn
	logicals to determine the work areas to be used for this DBMS server.
	Each of these logicals must be a full valid directory specification
	(i.e., partial specifications are not allowed).  For example, under the
	Unix operating system, "/usr/extra/work1" is a valid specification,
	whereas "test1/work" is not, because the path does not begin with a
	slash character.

 System Status:
	DBMS server startup will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Examine the currently defined set of work-area logicals.  These are
	named II_WORKDIR_xx_nn, where "xx" is the installation code (i.e., the
	value of the II_INSTALLATION logical), and "nn" is a number between 1
	and 16, inclusive.  If this installation has no installation code, the
	logicals are named II_WORKDIR_nn.  Consult the documentation for more
	details on correctly setting these logicals.


E_DM9053_INCONS_ALLOC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9054_BAD_LOG_RESERVE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0x - logging system transaction ID

 Explanation:
	The DBMS server must reserve space for a log record prior to
	performing the log write.  This error indicates that a problem
	has been detected in the space reservation code.  This error
	may be returned, for example, shortly after a database has
	been declared inconsistent.

 System Status:
	The transaction will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Other messages in the error log should more fully describe
	the condition that caused this problem.  


E_DM9055_AUDITDB_PRESCAN_FAIL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The auditdb process encountered an error during the pre-scan 
	phase that precluded successful completion.  Prior errors
	should identify the specific problem.

 System Status:
	The auditdb execution will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Other messages in the error log should more fully describe
	the condition that caused this problem.  


E_DM9056_CHECKSUM_DISABLE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This advisory message notes that the user has disabled DMF data page 
	checksumming.  This should not be done unless disk hardware performs
	equivalent checking, or unless directed to do so by Ingres Corporation 
	Technical Support (probably in response to checksum problems).

 System Status:
	Advisory message only.

 Recommendation:
	No action is required unless this capability has been inadvertently
	disabled.


E_DM9057_PM_CHKSM_INVALID:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message indicates that an invalid value has been specified
	for the "ii.*.dbms.page_checksums" PM parameter.  Valid values are
	ON or OFF.  Page checksumming is enabled after detection of this
	condition.

 System Status:
	Advisory message only.

 Recommendation:
	The PM parameter should be changed to a valid value.


E_DM9058_BAD_FILE_BUILD:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - pathname
	%3c - filename

 Explanation:
	This message indicates an error building the low-level file format
	for a catalog table.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for more information on why this occurred.


E_DM9059_TRAN_FORCE_ABORT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c      - database
	%1x, %2x - xid_high, xid_low

 Explanation:
	A force-abort occurs when the transaction log fills to the
	Force Abort level (configurable, but typically about 3/4 full).
	This transaction has been chosen to be forcibly aborted, to release
	transaction log space.

 System Status:
	The entire transaction is aborted, including the current statement.

 Recommendation:
	Reduce the size of the transaction, or commit sooner if possible,
	or use the WITH ON_LOGFULL=COMMIT session setting, or increase
	the size of the transaction log.


E_DM905A_ROW_DEADLOCK:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM905B_BAD_LOCK_ROW:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM905C_VALUE_DEADLOCK:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM905D_BAD_LOCK_VALUE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9060_SESSION_LOGGING_OFF:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c - database name
      %1d, %2d, %3d - log address

 Explanation:
      This message is logged whenever a user session executes the
      SET NOLOGGING statement.   It does not indicate an error, but
      points out the possibility for error.

      If a transaction running in this session fails, no recovery will
      be performed, and the database, while not listed as "inconsistent",
      will be left in an unknown state.

	Replaces E_DM9050_TRANSACTION_NOLOGGING.

 System Status:
      No effect on the current session/transaction.

 Recommendation:
      The user should be careful when using SET NOLOGGING and make
      sure that any errors returned to the session are trapped and
      appropriate action taken.  The appropriate action to take following
      an error in SET NOLOGGING mode is to restore the database from a
      valid checkpoint.


E_DM9061_JNLDB_LOGGING_ON:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c      - database
      %1d, %2d, %3d - log address

 Explanation:
      Session which has previously issued a 'set nologging' command
	has either issued a 'set logging' command, or the session is ending.
	Database is journaled.

 System Status:
      Logging is re-enabled for current session.

 Recommendation:
      Perform ckpdb.


E_DM9062_NON_JNLDB_LOGGING_ON:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c      - database
      %1d, %2d, %3d - log address

 Explanation:
      Session which has previously issued a 'set nologging' command
	has either issued a 'set logging' command, or the session is ending.
	Database is not journaled.

 System Status:
      Logging is re-enabled for current session.

 Recommendation:
      None.


E_DM9063_LK_TABLE_MAXLOCKS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9064_LK_ESCALATE_RELEASE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9065_DM9065_READNOLOCK_READUNCOMMITTED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9066_LOCK_BUSY:SS5000H_UNAVAILABLE_RESOURCE


 Parameters:
	%0	Table name.
	%1	Database name.  
	%2	Lock mode.       
	%3	Owner name, if available, else ?
	%4	Type of lock: 'ESCALATE', 'CONTROL', 'TABLE', 'PAGE nnnnn',
		'VALUE', 'ROW'.
	%5	Pid & session id of (one) user that holds the desired resource.

 Explanation:
	The lock could not be immediately granted and TIMEOUT = NOWAIT
	is in effect.

 System Status:
	The query has failed, but your transaction is still
	active and can be committed or aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The query may be retried. If the problem persists you may 
	use the session id provided in the message to track down
	who is holding the desired lock.

E_DM9078_ROW_LOCK_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9079_CONFIG_NAME_MISMATCH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - The name found in the database configuration file
	%1c - The expected database name

 Explanation:
	A sanity check on the database name in the database configuration
	file (aaaaaaaa.cnf) did not match.  This probably indicates that
	database files or directories were moved around or renamed manually.

 System Status:
	The database cannot be opened.  The session or DBA utility that
	is being run will abort.

 Recommendations:
	This error almost always indicates outside interference with the
	Ingres installation, which will have to be corrected.


E_DM9100_LOAD_TABLE_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9101_UPDATE_CATALOGS_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9102_BAD_MSG_FORMAT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9103_ERR_SENDING_MSG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	dm1u_talk() encountered a message from SCF while attempting to
	send a warning or informational message to the verifydb frontend.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Assure that server resources are available and that GCN is functioning.


E_DM9104_ERR_CK_PATCH_TBL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	dm1u_table() encountered an error while attempting to check or patch a
	table.  This is a generic catch-all type of error message that all
	lower level DMF INTERNAL error messages are translated to, so that
	the error exit path through DMF code can be traced for debugging
	purposes.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user should look at the error log to determine what DMF internal
	error was translated to this message, and take the appropriate action
	for that error.


E_DM9105_ERR_DEALLOC_MEMORY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.
 Explanation:
	dm1u_table() was unable to deallocate memory via a call to
	dm0m_deallocate() that it had previously allocated via a call
	to dm0m_allocate().

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Memory is corrupted.  The user should shut down the server and restart
	it at the first reasonable opportunity.


E_DM9106_ERR_ALLOC_MEMORY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.
 Explanation:
	dm1u_table() was unable to allocate memory via a dm0m_deallocate()
	call.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.
 Recommendation:
	Memory is corrupted.  The user should shut down the server and restart
	it at the first reasonable opportunity.


E_DM9107_BAD_DM1U_COMPRESS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.
 Explanation:
	dm1u_datapg() had determined that an attribute in a tuple was invalid
	during a patch operation, and was attempting to replace that bad
	attribute with a null or empty value. The table had compressed records,
	so dm1u_datapg() had to compress the record before replacing it on the
	page via a call to dm1c_comp_rec().  dm1c_comp_rec() returned an error
	status.

System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	A previous message from dm1c_comp_rec() will indicate error condition
	(out of locks, etc).  The user should correct that condition.


E_DM9108_FIXED_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0x - address of fixed page

 Explanation:
	dm1u_dchain() will fix and unfix pages to _RCB->rcb_data_page_ptr as it
	does its work.  Therefore, no pages should be fixed to the RCB when
	dm1u_dchain() is called, or information about that fixed page will be
	overwritten during dm1u_dchain() processing.  If there is a fixed page
	before dm1u_dchain() is called, the information about that fixed page
	will be lost, and DMF will not be able to unfix the page.  This will
	cause a server crash when DMF goes to close the table and the buffer
	manager detects that a page is still fixed.

 System Status:
	The statement (execute iiQEF_check_table) is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	This error should not be able to occur.  If it does occur, then either
	of two conditions has happened: 1) it is a coding error that must be
	filed as a bug and corrected; or, 2) there is memory corruption in the
	RCB, which will cause all sorts of DMF failures.  The user should call
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM9109_BAD_RELMAIN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - iirelation.relmain
	%1d - number of pages in the file

 Explanation:
	In order to check a hash table, we must know how many main pages there
	are in that hash table.  (Each main page may have 1 or more overflow
	pages associated with it).  The value of iirelation.relmain tells DMF
	how many main pages are in this hash table.  In this case, the
	iirelation.relmain value is not valid -- it is larger than the total
	number of pages in the file.

 System Status:
	The statement (execute iiQEF_check_table) is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user can update iirelation to have the correct values, if the user
	knows what those values should be (which is unlikely). The other option
	is to run the patch table operation, which will convert the table to
	heap and update iirelation to have the correct table description. Then
	the user may modify the table to the desired storage structure.


E_DM910A_DM1U_VERIFY_INFO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - table owner
	%2c - database name
	%3x - operation type being performed (either repair or patch)

 Explanation:
	This message is displayed when a user is either running the repair or
	patch operation on a table. These operations are normally run as
	a result of running verifydb on a table.

 System status:
	This is an informational message.

 Recommendation:
	None.



E_DM910B_BAD_SEC_LBL_ATT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
	The indicated table is marked as having per-row security labeling,
	but either no security label attribute was found, or it was not
	a valid security label.

 System status:
	Access is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	None.



E_DM910C_ERR_ROW_SEC_LABEL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was detected in a row security label. A previous error
	message should give more information.

 System status:
	Access is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log file for a previous message giving more
	information about why this occurred.


E_DM910D_ROW_MAC_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:

E_DM9113_PERPH_POS_ERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A call to position the table to retrieve records when checking
	the consistency of a peripheral coupon failed, please check the
	error log for more details.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The originating error should be logged into the error log, please
	check there, you may need to patch the table with verifydb
	before checking it's coupons.

E_DM928B_CONFIG_NOT_COMPATABLE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM928C_CONFIG_CONVERT_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered while converting the config file from 6.0
	to 6.3 format.  This could due to: an I/O error; the config
	file could need to be extended, and there is no disk space; the
	server could have run out of memory; or there could be a format
	error in the old config file.  There should be a previous error
	message in the error log detailing exactly what went wrong.

	This problem should only occur the first time a database that was
	created by Release 6.0 is opened by Release 6.3. When this is done,
	the system automatically converts the 6.0 config file to 6.3 format.

 System Status:
	The database will not be accessible by release 6.3 until it can be
	properly converted.

 Recommendation:
	The problem must be resolved and the config file converted in order
	to access the database with release 6.3. If all else fails, the database
	can be unloaded, then reloaded with a new 6.3 database.


E_DM928D_NO_DUMP_LOCATION:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	During online backup processing, the config file is written to the
	dump location.  This error is written if the config write routine
	cannot find the dump location in the config file's extent list.

 System Status:
	The online backup operation will not succeed.

 Recommendation:
	This error may be due to a config file format problem.  The only
	options for the user are to either unload and reload the data into
	a new database, or go back to a checkpoint that did not have this
	problem.


E_DM928E_CONFIG_FORMAT_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0 - size of structures
	%1 - first iirelation check
	%2 - second iirelation check
	%3 - iiattribute check
	%4 - iiindex check

 Explanation:
	The config file, aaaaaaaa.cnf, is inconsistent with the core system
	catalogs.

 System Status:
	The database is inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	This error may be due to a config file format problem.  The only
	options for the user are to either unload and reload the data into
	a new database, or go back to a checkpoint that did not have this
	problem.


E_DM928F_DM2F_ADD_FCB_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred during the addition of a new location to an
	already existing partially-open table descriptor.  The error
	log should contain a previous error message that gives more complete
	information about the error.  This messages serves as a traceback
	message as the stack unwinds.

 System Status:
	The operation which needed the new location will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Save error logs and trace logs for Ingres Corporation Technical 
	Support.

E_DM929A_DM0L_CRDB:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM929C_DM1S_EMPTYTABLE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This is a "trace back" message indicating that a problem has been
	encountered in the creation of a new table.   Prior messages
	should indicate the precise cause of the failure.

 System status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Fix the underlying problem and retry the operation.


E_DM929D_BAD_DIR_CREATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This indicates that an error has been encountered in the creation 
	of a directory during a database "extend" operation.  Prior 
	error messages should point to the exact cause of the problem.

 System status:
	The attempt to extend the database will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Fix the underlying problem and retry the operation.


E_DM929E_DM0L_EXT_ALTER:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM929F_DM2D_ALTER_DB:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when an internal error was detected while
	the DBMS server was trying to alter information in the
	configuration file.  This error should be issued after prior
	error messages which detail the problem.

 System Status:
	The transaction will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the contents of the error log to
	determine the cause of the error.


E_DM92A0_DMVE_ALTER_UNDO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when an internal error was detected while
	the DBMS server was trying to UNDO an extent alteration transaction.
      The server was manipulating location information in the configuration
      file when an error occurred; UNDO processing ensued, but when the
      server attempted to rollback what it had done, the location could not
      be found in the configuration file.  

 System Status:
	The transaction will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
      This is a bug and should be reported.


E_DM92A1_DM2D_EXT_MISMATCH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c - location name

 Explanation:
	This message is logged when the DBMS server finds that the
      information in the iiextend catalog (which is where accessdb gets
      its information) did not match internal database information from the
      configuration file.  This means that accessdb may have been showing
      information in one state, while the database actually behaved in a
      different state.  For example, a work location could have been
      marked as "auxiliary" when viewed in accessdb, but when using the
      database it behaved as if it were a "defaultable" work location.
      This message does not indicate that an error just occurred, but rather
      that an error occurred prior to this, and it is now being detected
      and logged.

 System Status:
      This condition will be corrected; information between the iiextend
      catalog and the database should now be in sync.

 Recommendation:
      If this happens repeatedly, please contact Ingres Corporation 
	Technical Support.


E_DM92A2_DM2D_LAST_TBID:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c 	- Database name
      %1d 	- Old last table id
      %2d 	- New last table id

 Explanation:
	This message is logged when the the "last table id" field of the
      configuration file is changed by a dm2d_alter_table call.  It is
      not understood when this event occurs.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:
      Notify Technical Support.


E_DM92A3_NAME_GEN_OVF:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Temporary filenames for DDL statements (modify, index, drop) are
	generated using a running server-wide sequence number.  If more
	than 3,522,862,626 temporary names are generated, the sequence
	number overflows.  There is no safe way to wrap the generator back
	to zero, as the lifetime of temporary files is unpredictable.
	This event is only expected if a server has been up and
	continuously active for several years.

 System Status:
	This is a fatal error and the server crashes.

 Recommendation:
	Restart the installation yearly to restart the temporary
	name sequence.  If this failure occurs without the server having
	been up for at least 2 years, notify Technical Support.


E_DM92BF_DM1P_TABLE_TOO_BIG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - maximum table size
	%1c - database name
	%2c - table owner
	%3c - table name
	%4d - current table's size (in pages)
	%5d - table's extend size

 Explanation:
	There is no free space left in the table, causing the DBMS to extend
	the table. This extension is causing the table to grow past the
	current maximum table size and, therefore, is failing.

 System Status:
	The statement which encountered the error will have been backed
	out and the database should be accessible.

 Recommendation:
	Free up some space within the table.


E_DM92CA_SMS_CONV_NEEDED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This release adds new page formats to track space within a table;
	all existing tables need to be converted to this format. The DBMS
	catalogs have not yet been converted, hence the database cannot be
	opened until this occurs.

 Recommendation:
	Run upgradedb on this database.


E_DM92CB_DM1P_ERROR_INFO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table Name
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
	An error occurred in the table/index space management code during
	one of the following operations: build table, allocate a page,
	deallocate a page. There should be previous errors in the error log 
	describing in more detail what went wrong.

 System Status:
	The statement which encountered the error will have been backed
	out and the database should be accessible.

 Recommendation:
	Examine the error log for the exact reason for the error, and
	try to correct the problem.  A common cause of this type of
	problem is a disk-full situation.


E_DM92CC_ERR_CONVERT_TBL_INFO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - reltid of table
	%1d - reltidx of table
	%2c - database name

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered while converting a table from the 6.4
	(or lower) format to the current version. There should be previous
	messages in the error log detailing exactly what went wrong and the
	table or index affected.

	This problem should only occur when converting a database to the
	new version.

 System Status:
	The status of the database depends on which table or index the
	error occurred on. If a DBMS catalog was affected, the database
	will not accessible by the new version of the DBMS until it can
	be properly converted.  If a user table was affected, the
	database should be available, but further errors will occur on the
	table with problems.

 Recommendation:
	If a DBMS catalog was affected, the problem must be resolved
	before the new version of the DBMS can access the database. For all
	other tables, the user may be able to modify or reload the table.
	Secondary indexes should be dropped and recreated. If all else fails,
	the database may be unloaded from the old version and reloaded into
	the new DBMS version.


E_DM92CD_DM2U_CONVERT_ERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered while converting a table from the 6.4
	(or lower) format to the current version. There should be previous
	messages in the error log detailing exactly what went wrong and the
	table or index affected.

	This problem should only occur when converting a database to the
	new version.

 System Status:
	The status of the database depends on which table or index the
	error occurred on. If a DBMS catalog was affected, the database
	will not accessible by the new version of the DBMS until it can
	be properly converted.  If a user table was affected, the
	database should be available, but further errors will occur on the
	table with problems.

 Recommendation:
	If a DBMS catalog was affected, the problem must be resolved
	before the new version of the DBMS can access the database. For all
	other tables, the user may be able to modify or reload the table.
	Secondary indexes should be dropped and recreated. If all else fails,
	the database may be unloaded from the old version and reloaded into the
	new version.

E_DM92D7_DM1P_DUMP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM92D8_DM1P_VERIFY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered while trying to verify a table's
	FHDR/FMAP(s) structure. There should be previous errors in the 
	error log describing in more detail what went wrong and what
	table/index is affected.

 System Status:
	The table/index in question cannot be accessed until the FHDR/FMAP(s)
	have been repaired.

 Recommendation:
	The only fully supported technique for resolving the problem is 
	to run rollforwarddb on the database.  

	If this is not possible, verifydb may be able to recover data so
	that the table can be recreated.

E_DM92EB_DM1P_CVT_TABLE_TO_65:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered while converting a table from the 6.4
	(or lower) format to the current version. There should be previous
	errors in the error log describing in more detail what went wrong
	and what table/index is affected.

	This problem should only occur when converting a database to the
	new version.

 System Status:
	The status of the database depends on which table or index the
	error occurred on. If a DBMS catalog was affected, the database
	will not accessible by the new version of the DBMS until it can
	be properly converted.  If a user table was affected, the
	database should be available, but further errors will occur on the
	table with problems.

 Recommendation:
	If a DBMS catalog was affected, the problem must be resolved
	before the new version of the DBMS can access the database. For all
	other tables, the user may be able to modify or reload the table.
	Secondary indexes should be dropped and recreated. If all else fails,
	the database may be unloaded from the old version and reloaded into the

E_DM92ED_DM1P_BAD_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM92EC_DM1P_ADD_EXTEND:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred while a user was trying to add new pages to
	a table or index. There should be previous errors in the error 
	log describing in more detail what went wrong and what table or
	index is affected.

	The main cause of this error is requesting more new pages than
	available disk space.

 System Status:
	Depending on which disk(s) is full, the database may still be
	accessible, and the table should not be left in a corrupt state. 
	Any new pages that have been added to the table or index can only 
	be released if there is enough disk space to re-MODIFY the table.

 Recommendation:
	Free disk space on the appropriate disk(s).

E_DM92FF_DM2D_CONV_TO_65_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message accompanies E_DM93A5 and serves to "trace back" the flow
	of control to give a better indication of the actual DMF operation
	which encountered the DM93A5 error. This message follows DM93A5 in the
	error log, and will be followed in turn by additional DMF messages
	which will pinpoint the DMF operation which was in progress.

 System Status:
	The statement or transaction is aborted; server operation continues.

 Recommendation:
	This message probably indicates an internal bug. Save the error
	log information and contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support. 
	If you can isolate a reproducible test case, this will greatly aid 
	in problem diagnosis.

E_DM930B_DM0P_DEALLOCATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM930C_DM0P_PAGE_CHKSUM_FAIL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database Name
	%1c - table Name
	%2d - page Number

 Explanation:
	This is an indication that a page checksum has failed.  Page checksum 
	failures occur most often as a result of hardware failures, but 
	may also occur as a result of a bug in the server.  

 System Status:
	The transaction or statement which encountered this error is aborted.
	The page is not read into cache.

 Recommendation:
	First it should be determined if hardware problems are causing
	the checksum errors (VMS "show device" or UNIX /usr/adm/messages).
	If it appears that hardware problems are the cause, the 
	errors will likely disappear when the problem is resolved.

	If checksum problems persist, the only fully supported technique 
	for resolving the problem is to run rollforwarddb on the database.  

	Unsupported trace points are available to disable checksumming and
	to report checksum errors to II_DBMS_LOG without having errors returned
	to the caller.  Use of these trace points is dangerous, however, as
	they effectively tell the DBMS to ignore bad data on a page.  Contact
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support for more information on 
	trace points and related actions.

	There is a small chance that checksum errors may occur as a result
	of a bug in the server.  If it appears that this is the case, the user 
	should save all relevant information, including system console
	information, and report the problem to Ingres Corporation Technical 
	Support.


E_DM930D_DM2U_READONLY_UPD_CATS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner

 Explanation:
	An error occurred while updating the system catalogs.

 System Status:
	The DDL statement will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Examine the error log for more information.

E_DM9317_DM2R_TID_ACCESS_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A table that does not support TIDs (probably a gateway table) was
	queried with a TID qualifier.  This could be caused by the server
	choosing a bad query plan which uses TID access inappropriately, or
	by the user specifying a query with a TID qualifier.

 System Status:
	The query will be rejected.

 Recommendation:
	If the user is using queries with a TID qualifier on a table which does
	not contain TIDs, then the user should restructure the query.

E_DM9349_DM1H_NOFULL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM934A_BTREE_NOROOM:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An internal error occurred while updating the index of a btree table.
	A split operation was performed to create space to insert a record
	into the btree index, but when the split was complete, there was still
	insufficient space to insert the new record.

 System Status:
	The insert will fail and its transaction will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Record all messages in the error log.  Retry the query, and if it still
	fails, then recreate btree index, if possible.


E_DM934B_DM1B_DUPCHECK:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An internal error occurred while checking for duplicates (either
	duplicate keys or duplicate rows) in a btree table.  The system
	error log should contain messages logged just prior to this one
	which will give further details about the cause of the error.

 System Status:
	The operation will fail, and its transaction will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for specifics about the query failure.
	If possible, try rebuilding the btree index.

E_DM937C_BM_BUFMGR_LOCK_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM937D_BM_CONNECTIONS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - buffer manager name
	%1d - new connect count
	%2d - old connect count

 Explanation:
	The buffer manager's internal count of the number of servers connected
	to it does not match the number of holders of the buffer manager lock.
	This probably indicates that a server exited abnormally without
	decrementing the buffer manager connect count.  This message should
	be followed by E_DMF025_BM_CONNECT_COUNT and then a shutdown of the
	server.  See notes by that error message for further information.

 System Status:
	The server is shut down. All other servers connected to this same
	buffer manager will also be shut down automatically.

 Recommendation:
	Restart the servers -- examine the error log to see the reason why
	the server exited abnormally.  This could have happened due to a server
	fatal error or because the user stopped the DBMS server process rather
	than shutting it down normally.


E_DM937E_TCB_BUSY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM937F_BM_NOT_A_BUFMGR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - buffer manager name

 Explanation:
	The server connected to specified shared memory segment, but the
	segment did not contain a proper control block type, BMCB_CB. This
	could mean that the buffer manager has been corrupted.

 System Status:
	The server will not start.

 Recommendation:
	All servers connected to this buffer manager should probably be
	shut down.

E_DM9384_DM2T_UPD_LOGKEY_ERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9385_NO_INDEX_TUPLE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - TID of base table row being updated

 Explanation:
	An update was made on a table that has a secondary index.  When the
	system attempted to update the corresponding secondary index row, it
	was unable to find a row describing the updated tuple of the base
	table.

 System Status:
	The update will be rejected and the statement aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The index table may be invalid. Other errors in the error log may give
	an indication of the reason for failing to find the index row.  If the
	system seems to be functioning correctly, but the row cannot be
	updated, recreating the secondary index may be necessary.


E_DM9386_SEC_INDEX_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - name of secondary index
	        (blank if failed during open of secondary index)
	%1d - TID of base table row being updated

 Explanation:
	An update was made on a table that has a secondary index.  A failure
	occurred attempting to update the corresponding secondary index entry.

 System Status:
	The update will be rejected and the statement aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Other errors in the error log should give an indication of the reason
	for the failure.  If bringing down the server cannot solve the problem,
	recreating the secondary index may be necessary.


E_DM9387_INDEX_UPDATE_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An update was made on a table that has a secondary index.  A failure
	occurred attempting to update the corresponding secondary index entry.

 System Status:
	The update will be rejected and the statement aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Other errors in the error log should give an indication of the reason
	for failure. If bringing down the server cannot solve the problem,
	recreating the secondary index may be necessary.


E_DM9388_BAD_DATA_LENGTH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - length given in length descriptor

 Explanation:
	A VARCHAR or TEXT datatype has been encountered that has a length
	descriptor that gives an impossible length.  This means this row
	is probably corrupted.  This error is probably encountered while trying
	to compress or uncompress the tuple -- in these cases the length value
	is needed.

	If the error is returned on an insert, then the bad row will not be
	added to the database.  If this error is returned on a select, then
	the bad row is probably already in the database.

 System Status:
	The query will be rejected in the normal case, and the transaction
	will be aborted.  These actions can be altered by trace flags,
	described below.

 Recommendation:
	This error probably indicates a bad row.  If this error is returned on
	a select, then the table needs to be fixed. Following this error should
	be an E_DM938A_BAD_DATA_ROW error that will give the TID of the bad
	row.  The user should attempt to select the row by TID to verify that
	this row is really unable to be returned from the database.

	The table probably needs some type of recovery to fix the bad row.
	See the Recommendation below on error E_DM938A_BAD_DATA_ROW.


E_DM9389_BAD_DATA_VALUE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A bad data value was encountered in the database that could not be
	interpreted by DMF.  This error should be followed by an E_DM938A
	error which indicates the TID of the bad tuple.

	If the error is returned on an insert, then the bad row will not be
	added to the database.  If this error is returned on a select, then
	the bad row is probably already in the database.

 System Status:
	The query will be rejected and the transaction aborted.

 Recommendation:
	See error E_DM938A_BAD_DATA_ROW.


E_DM938A_BAD_DATA_ROW:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - TID of bad row

 Explanation:
	A bad row was encountered in the database that could not be
	interpreted by DMF.

	If the error is returned on an insert, then the bad row will not be
	added to the database.  If this error is returned on a select, then
	the bad row is probably already in the database.

 System Status:
	The query will be rejected in the normal case, and the transaction
	will be aborted.  The error recovery actions can be altered by the
	trace flags described below.

 Recommendation:
	If this error is returned on a SELECT statement then there is probably
	a bad row in the database.  The user should do a select by TID of the
	reported row to make sure that it really is bad.  The table should be
	recovered -- methods for doing this are described below.

	The supported method of fixing a table like this is to recover it from
	the last checkpoint.  If this is not practical or possible, the table
	can be patched by removing the offending row.  There are two trace
	flags provided for this -- these are undocumented trace flags that are
	not intended to be distributed for general use!

	SET TRACE POINT DM801 will cause DMF to skip bad rows like this when
	scanning the table.  Thus, the user could do:

	        set trace point DM801
	        modify table to storage_structure

	which would have the effect of rebuilding the table without any
	of the offending rows.

	SET TRACE POINT DM802 will cause DMF to return a garbage row when a
	bad row is encountered.  This allows the user to do:

	        set trace point DM802
	        delete table where table.tid = BAD_TID
	        set notrace point DM802

	This will delete the offending row directly. This is the only operation
	that should be attempted while having this trace flag on, as it may
	cause unexpected and unpredictable results if used while SELECTing a
	bad row.


E_DM938B_INCONSISTENT_ROW:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A bad row was encountered in the database that could not be
	interpreted by DMF.

	If the error is returned on an insert, then the bad row will not be
	added to the database.  If this error is returned on a select, then
	the bad row is probably already in the database.

 System Status:
	The query will be rejected and the transaction aborted.

 Recommendation:
	See E_DM938A_BAD_DATA_ROW description.


E_DM938C_BM_CLUSTER_CONNECT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - name of shared buffer cache

 Explanation:
	When running in a VAXcluster environment, a DBMS server thought that
	the specified shared buffer cache should be available on the system
	since the lock that identifies that cache was held.  The server,
	however, was unable to connect to the segment and got a NO SUCH SEGMENT
	return code.

	The error is probably caused by the user trying to start two servers
	on different nodes of the VAXcluster, specifying the same shared cache
	name.

 System Status:
	The server will fail to start.

 Recommendation:
	Check for servers on other nodes using the same cache name.  Use
	different shared cache for servers on different nodes.


E_DM938D_SHARED_MEM_ALLOCATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - number of pages in buffer cache
	%1d - number of bytes required for shared cache
	%2d - number of OS pages required for shared cache

 Explanation:
	The operating system could not give enough shared memory to allocate a
	cache with the specified size.

 System Status:
	The server will fail to start.

 Recommendation:
	Start the server with smaller cache size, or make more shared memory
	available to system.


E_DM938E_BM_MEDESTROY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Could not destroy the shared memory segment associated with the
	shared buffer cache.  This occurred during server shutdown when the
	last server connected to the shared cache was exiting.

	On VMS systems, the shared segment will be automatically deallocated
	when the server process exits.  On most Unix systems, where the
	shared segments must be explicitly deallocated, the shared segment will
	be left allocated until the next server attempts to use this cache.

 System Status:
	On some systems (Unix), the shared memory segment will be left on the
	system.

 Recommendation:
	The next time a server starts up it will destroy the segment. Otherwise
	the segment must be destroyed by hand, using the cacheutil program.


E_DM938F_DM0L_DMU:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Could not write log record for DMU operation.  This record is written
	for CREATE, DESTROY, MODIFY, INDEX, RELOCATE and ALTER operations.

	This error will occur following a bad Log Alter (LGalter()) or Log
	Write (LGwrite()) while logging the DMU operation.

	There should be a previous error message describing the reason
	for the failure.

 System Status:
	The transaction will be aborted.  The DMU operation will not succeed.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for the exact reason for the failure.  There should
	be an E_DM9015_BAD_LOG_WRITE or E_DM900B_BAD_LOG_ALTER error message
	describing in more detail what operation failed.


E_DM9390_DM0A_BAD_AUDIT_WRITE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	DMF could not write a security audit record.

	This error will occur following a SXF write error.

	There should be a previous error message describing the reason
	for the failure.

 System Status:
	The transaction will be aborted.  The DMF operation will not succeed.
	Depending on the SXF error handling, the DBMS server may shut down.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for the exact reason for the failure.  


E_DM9391_DM0L_FSWAP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Could not write log record for FSWAP operation.  This record is written
	to log file rename operations during MODIFY or LOAD operation.

	This error will occur following a bad Log Write (LGwrite()) while
	logging the FSWAP operation.

	There should be a previous error message describing the reason
	for the failure.

 System Status:
	The transaction will be aborted.  The DMU operation will not succeed.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for the exact reason for the failure.  There should
	be an E_DM9015_BAD_LOG_WRITE error message describing in more detail
	what operation failed.


E_DM9392_DM0D_CONFIG_RESTORE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	During an online checkpoint, the DBMS writes a copy of the config
	file to the database DUMP directory (II_DUMP).  When restoring
	to that checkpoint, the config file is overwritten with the
	contents in the DUMP copy.

	This error is raised when rollforwarddb is unable to restore the
	config file using the DUMP copy.  This may occur because of I/O
	errors, permission errors, or if the config copy is missing.

	The DUMP copy of the config file will be named cnnnnnn.dmp where
	"nnnnnn" is the checkpoint sequence number.

	This message should be preceded by more detailed error messages
	giving the exact nature of the error.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Check previous error messages to determine if the problem can be
	resolved by fixing system conditions (freeing disk space, bringing
	disk volume on-line, etc.). If the problem seems to be that the config
	file copy is corrupted, then the checkpoint may not be usable.  It is
	possible that using a different copy of the config file will resolve
	the problem.


E_DM9393_DM0D_NO_DMP_CONFIG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.
 Explanation:
	During an online checkpoint, the DBMS writes a copy of the config
	file to the database DUMP directory (II_DUMP).  When restoring
	to that checkpoint, the config file is overwritten with the
	contents in the DUMP copy.

	This error is raised when rollforwarddb is unable to find the
	config file that corresponds to this checkpoint.

	The DUMP copy of the config file will be named cnnnnnn.dmp where
	"nnnnnn" is the checkpoint sequence number.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	This checkpoint may not be usable.  It is possible that using a
	different copy of the config file will resolve the problem.



E_DM9394_DM0D_CONFIG_DELETE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error occurs during checkpoint if the "-d" option is specified
	and old DUMP config files cannot be deleted.

	The "-d" option specifies to delete old checkpoint information.
	This includes: checkpoint files, dump files, and config files.

	This message should be preceded by more detailed error messages
	giving the exact nature of the error.

 System Status:
	The checkpoint will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Check previous error messages to see if there is a system problem
	that can be resolved (e.g., permissions). If the problem cannot be
	resolved, a workaround is to use checkpoint without the "-d" flag
	and to delete old checkpoints by hand.


E_DM9395_SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN_TEST:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The system was brought down by the system crash test trace flag.
	This is used during product validation to simulate actual system
	crashes so that the recovery system can be tested.

 System Status:
	The logging system shuts down immediately -- possibly leaving
	active transactions to recover when the system is restarted.

 Recommendation:
	Restart the installation and allow recovery to clean up any
	work in progress.


E_DM9396_BT_WRONG_PAGE_FIXED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0 - name of the table being updated
	%1 - owner of the table being updated
	%2 - page number which should have been fixed
	%3 - page number which was fixed
	%4 - btree ID of the leaf entry being updated
	%5 - tuple ID of the row being updated

 Explanation:
	This is an internal consistency check in the btree update code.
	If code in the DBMS passes in the wrong page to the btree update
	routines, then this error will be generated.  There should be
	no user error or hardware/environment problem that can cause this
	error.

 System Status:
	The query will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Report the error as a bug.  Check the table for btree consistency 
	problems.


E_DM9397_CP_INCOMPLETE_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0 - buffer which was skipped
	%1 - base table ID for the buffer
	%2 - index table ID for the buffer
	%3 - buffer status mask
	%4 - cp count in the buffer header
	%5 - global buffer manager cp count
	%6 - buffer's reference count
	%7 - server's TCB pointer for the buffer's table
	%8 - buffer's TCB validation value
	%9 - validation stamp in the TCB

 Explanation:
	This error is written just prior to the server shutting down due to an
	error executing a consistency point.  If at the end of processing a
	consistency point, a server notices that it has not flushed all the
	necessary pages from the buffer manager, it will signal a protocol
	error.  This message attempts to output enough useful information to
	help track down the cause of the error.

 System Status:
	The server will crash shortly after logging this error.

 Recommendation:
	Report the error as a bug.  Save the error log.  If there
	is a DBMS trace file, save that as well, as it will contain the
	dmd_check() which is to follow.  If there is no DBMS trace file, then
	define one when the server is restarted so that, if the problem is
	repeated, more complete information can be obtained.


E_DM9398_SD_INFO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0 - database name
	%1 - table name
	%2 - physical pathname
	%3 - physical filename
	%4 - status returned from the SDinformation() call

 Explanation:
	The server tried to ask the host operating system whether Smart Disk
	facilities were available for the given file, and the inquiry failed.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	If the cause of the operating system error code cannot readily
	be determined, report the error as a DBMS or host OS bug.


E_DM9399_SD_POSITION_TYPE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0 - database name
	%1 - table name
	%2 - physical pathname
	%3 - physical filename
	%4 - (no meaningful value)

 Explanation:
	A Smart Disk position was attempted during a non-Smart Disk query.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Report the error as a bug.


E_DM939A_SD_PAGE_ALLOC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0 - database name
	%1 - table name
	%2 - physical pathname
	%3 - physical filename
	%4 - error returned by dm0m_allocate()

 Explanation:
	Memory for a Smart Disk buffer was unavailable.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Increase system virtual or physical memory limits.


E_DM939B_SD_FORCE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0 - database name
	%1 - table name
	%2 - physical pathname
	%3 - physical filename
	%4 - error returned by dm0p_close_page()

 Explanation:
	The server attempted to flush all of a table's modified cache
	pages to disk before performing a Smart Disk scan, and was
	unable to.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	If no I/O or host OS error is apparent, report the error as a
	bug.


E_DM939C_SD_NOT_POSITIONED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0 - database name
	%1 - table name
	%2 - physical pathname
	%3 - physical filename
	%4 - (no meaningful value)

 Explanation:
	Before a Smart Disk retrieval can be attempted, the table must
	first be positioned for a Smart Disk scan.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Could not write log record for TEST operation.  This record is written
	to the log file as part of the logging and journaling system tests.

	This error will occur following a bad Log Write (LGwrite()) while
	logging the TEST operation.

	There should be a previous error message describing the reason
	for the failure.

 System Status:
	The transaction will be aborted.

E_DM93A0_ROLLFORWARD_JNLDISABLE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	A rollforwarddb is being done on a database which has had journaling
	disabled.  This is not a supported operation.

	Since journaling has been disabled, the database journal information
	must not be consistent.  Rolling forward using inconsistent journal
	records is not supported -- although may sometimes be done using the
	appropriate "-e" flag setting to rollforwarddb up to the point at which
	errors began occurring.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb process will continue only if the "#f" flag was
	specified.

 Recommendation:
	Evaluate whether rollforward processing is really desired.
	Use "rollforwarddb #f" to force rollforward to proceed.


E_DM93A1_AUDITDB_JNLDISABLE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	An auditdb is being done on a database which has had journaling

	the DBMS server. The server is trying to allocate more
	space to a table and finds that the table's extend size is set
	to a non-sensible value.

 System Status:
	The statement that encountered this error will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Notify Ingres Corporation Technical Support. Please save the error 
	log, the iircp.log file, and all other diagnostic information, as 
	this will be required by Ingres Corporation Technical Support 
	personnel to diagnose the problem.


E_DM93A6_EXTEND_DB:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:

	%1c     - table name
	%2c     - table owner
	%3c     - database name
	%4d     - page number on page
	%5x     - page_stat value
	%6x,%7x - log address of record describing last change to the page
	%8x,%9x - transaction that last changed the page

 Explanation:
	This error is given if a page is read out of a database file and
	its page number does not match the position in the file from which
	it was read.  This would normally mean that the file/page has
	been corrupted.

 System Status:
	The query running will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	If possible, the user should recover the table, using rollforwarddb.
	If this is not possible, verifydb may be able to recover data so
	that the table can be recreated.


E_DM93A8_DM0P_WPASS_ABORT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c     - database ID
	%1d,%2d - table ID
	%3d     - page number

 Explanation:
	This error is given if an error is encountered while the server
	is tossing pages from its cache in preparation for asking the
	RCP to recover a transaction for it.

 System Status:
	The transaction abort will be done by the RCP.

 Recommendation:
	Wait for recovery to complete, then continue as normal.


E_DM93A9_BM_FORCE_PAGE_EOF:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - page number
	%4d - number of pages in write request
	%5d - table EOF

 Explanation:
	This error is given if a request is made from within the buffer
	manager to write a page that has not been allocated to the table.
	This could mean that the page_number is invalid (incorrectly set
	to some large value), or that an error in file extend protocols
	has caused us to forget to allocate the space before attempting to
	flush the page from the cache.

 System Status:
	The query running will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The database should be left in a consistent state, having failed
	to complete the illegal action.  Should retries to execute the
	query fail, the user should check consistency of the table with
	the verifydb utility.


E_DM93AA_READ_TCB:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when an internal error is detected within
	the read_tcb() function.  This is a traceback message, with
	other messages further identifying the specific problem.

 System Status:
	The system state depends on the higher layer code that
	requested the read operation.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_DM93AB_MAP_PAGE_TO_FMAP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - first_free
	%4d - map_index
	%5d - fmap_block
	%6d - fhdr_count

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when an internal error is detected within
	the DBMS server. The server is trying to calculate the location
	of the FMAP page for the pageno in first_free and encountered one of
	two problems:

	  - The pageno, first_free, maps to a non-existent FMAP page, i.e.,
	    map_index is greater than the number of FMAPS for this table,
	    fhdr_count.

	  - The FMAP has a FHDR entry but the pageno of the required FMAP
	    evaluates to zero, fmap_block.

	The error is most likely to occur during abort processing of a copy
	into a heap table.

 System Status:
	The database may be left in an inconsistent state, since the DBMS
	encountered problems aborting a query.

 Recommendation:
	Notify Ingres Corporation Technical Support. Please save the 
	error log, the iircp.log file, and all other diagnostic information, 
	as this will be required by Ingres Corporation Technical Support 
	personnel to diagnose the problem.  The table should be recovered 
	using rollforwarddb.

E_DM93EE_BAD_INDEX_RESERVE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM93EF_DM1P_REPAIR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered while trying to repair a table's
	FHDR/FMAP(s) structure. There should be previous errors in the 
	error log describing in more detail what went wrong and what
	table/index is affected.

 System Status:
	The table/index in question cannot be accessed until the FHDR/FMAP(s)
	have been repaired.

E_DM9423_RCP_DIS_DUAL_LOGGING:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9424_RCP_HARD_SHUTDOWN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The RCP was told to shut down while there were still active DBMS
	processes.

	This error will be logged when the imm_shutdown option of rcpconfig
	is issued.  It may also be logged if rcpconfig shutdown is issued
	and some error occurs during the shutdown process.

 System Status:
	The installation will have been shut down -- the system is not
	in a bad state, but there may be active transactions that require
	recovery in order to bring the installation to a consistent state.
	This recovery will be done automatically when the installation
	is restarted.

 Recommendation:
	When the installation is restarted, then all needed recovery will
	be performed.


E_DM9425_MEMORY_ALLOCATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - amount of memory requested (in bytes)

 Explanation:
	A memory allocation request failed.

	This error should be followed by further error messages giving
	the specific operation that required the memory.

 System Status:
	The operation requested could not be performed due to the memory
	allocation error.

 Recommendation:
	Check the operation being performed and the requested memory size.
	If the memory size seems abnormally large, then this error could
	be the result of an internal bug.  Otherwise, this probably indicates
	that the system has exhausted its memory resources.


E_DM9426_LGADD_SIZE_MISMATCH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - size of DM0L_ADDDB structure
	%1d - definition of LG_DBINFO_MAX

 Explanation:
	This error probably indicates that a change was made to the
	constants DB_MAXNAME or DB_AREA_MAX and that a similar
	increase needs to be made to the logging system LG_DBINFO_MAX
	constant.  This is so the logging system will allocate enough
	space to store the maximum size path/name for a database.

	This error should never occur on a user system.  It indicates
	an internal build error and will be generated when the
	system is first started up.

 System Status:
	The installation will not run.  The logging system must be rebuilt
	with the new LG constant definition.

 Recommendation:
	None -- this error should never occur on a user system.


E_DM9427_DM0M_MEMORY_ALLOCATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - amount of memory requested
	%1d - amount of memory allocated so far
	%2d - amount of memory used by DMF routines
	%3d - amount of DM0M memory still free

 Explanation:
	Memory allocation request failed.  This may be due to hitting limits
	defined by:

	  - server or process quotas
	  - resource limits defined by server startup parameters
	  - system memory resources

	The error log should be examined for any operating system
	specific messages indicating reasons for the failure to allocate
	memory.

 System Status:
	Will be dependent upon the type of allocation that has failed.  Could
	result in anything from query failure to server failure.

 Recommendation:
	Examine system/process quotas and memory limits.


E_DM9429_EXPAND_POOL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error encountered in the expand_pool() function extended the
	virtual address space of a process.

 System Status:
	Resulting action depends on the circumstances in which the
	problem was detected.  Other error messages should identify
	the consequences of this problem more precisely.

 Recommendation:
	If possible, add to the memory available to the process.


E_DM942A_RCP_DBINCON_FAIL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The II_DMFRCP_STOP_ON_INCONS_DB environment variable is used
	to request that the installation be shut down 
	rather than mark a database inconsistent.  This error
	is generated when such a situation occurs.  That is,
	the RCP has brought down the installation because
	it found a recovery situation that would have caused it
	to mark a database inconsistent.  Additional information
	about why the database is being so marked, along with
	a dump of internal server information, should be available
	in the RCP log file.

 System Status:
	The system is down and subsequent recoveries will fail until
	either the underlying problem is fixed or the
	II_DMFRCP_STOP_ON_INCONS_DB environment variable is reset.

 Recommendation:
	It is incumbent upon the system operator to examine the RCP
	log file data and any other available diagnostic information
	(e.g., (Unix) /usr/adm/messages, (VMS) console error log)
	to determine if the cause of the inconsistent database
	can be fixed.  Possible problems and resulting actions are as
	follows:

	       Problem                        Solution

	  1) RCP ran out of               Free up space on disk
	     available disk space         and restart the system.

	  2) VMS quota exceeded           Increase quota and
	                                  restart system.

	  3) RCP ran out of 		  Reconfigure the DBMS to
	     resource (e.g. locks)        provide additional resource.

	  4) Operator error               If possible, reverse
	                                  the operator action and retry
	                                  the startup attempt.

	  5) Disk hard failure,           a) Unset II_DMFRCP_STOP_ON_INCONS_DB,
	     or                              using ingunset.
	     Recovery software failure    b) Allow RCP to mark database
	                                     inconsistent and system
	                                     to come up.
	                                  c) Run rollforwarddb on the database.


E_DM942B_CRASH_LOG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - name of the crash log located in the files directory.

 Explanation:
	If the server is about to crash as a result of an internally
	detected problem and no II_DBMS_LOG has been defined, a "crash
	log" will be created.  This error messages indicates that
	indeed this case has been encountered, and includes
	the name of the file.  Note on Unix that if several servers crash,
	none of which have an II_DBMS_LOG, crash log information
	will be appended to the end of a single file.  This could
	potentially make the file quite large.  On VMS, multiple
	versions of the crash log file will be created in this case.

 System Status:
	Server shutdown follows immediately.  Further information
	can be found in the crash log file and in other error log
	messages.

 Recommendation:
	Recovery will automatically be performed by the RCP.
	Messages preceding this one should point to the cause of the problem 
	and the resolution.  If the problem is not clear from preceding 
	messages, Ingres Corporation Technical Support should be notified.  
	The crash log file should be preserved for post-mortem analysis.


E_DM942C_DMPP_ROW_UNCOMP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - page number
	%4x - TID 
	%5d - record size
	%6d - uncompressed record size

 Explanation:
	This is an internal debugging message. It documents a serious 
	problem in uncompressing a row.  If the "record size" and 
	"uncompressed record size" parameters are non-zero, the problem
	is that the uncompressed record does not match its original length.
	If both of these parameters are zero, the problem relates to a buffer
	overflow occurring within the uncompression routine.  In any case,
	the error should be reported to Ingres Corporation Technical Support 
	for analysis and resolution.

 System Status:
	The transaction or statement which encountered this error is aborted.
	The table may or may not be structurally corrupt. Operations on other
	tables and other databases will continue unaffected by this error.

 Recommendation:
	Please save the error log and contact Ingres Corporation Technical 
	Support for assistance in debugging and resolving this problem.


E_DM942D_RCP_ONLINE_CONTEXT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred during RCP online recovery.  The RCP could not
	build its recovery context from information in the logging system.
	The error was likely the result of an error from a logging system call.

 System Status:
	The RCP will fail and will need to be restarted to execute offline
	recovery.

 Recommendation:
	Please save the RCP log file and the error log and contact
	Technical Support for assistance in debugging and resolving
	this problem.


E_DM942E_RCP_INCOMPLETE_CP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred during RCP offline recovery. The RCP could not build
	its recovery context from information in the last consistency point. 

 System Status:
	The RCP will not start up.  This may be an indication of a bad
	log file and may require a log-file reinitialization in order to
	restart the system.

 Recommendation:
	Save the RCP log file and the error log and run logdump to aid in 
	debugging and resolving this problem.  The log file may need to be 
	reinitialized to allow the RCP to start.  Contact Ingres Corporation
	Technical Support.


E_DM942F_RCP_CHECK_RECOVERY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred during RCP recovery while reading config file
	information for a database to determine whether or not the database
	needs to be recovered.

 System Status:
	The RCP will skip recovery on the database, and that database will
	likely be marked inconsistent the next time it is accessed.

 Recommendation:
	Examine the error log to determine the reason for the error.  Check 
	the database location and the existence of the config file 
	(aaaaaaaa.cnf).  The database may need to be recovered from a 
	checkpoint.


E_DM9430_RCP_CHECK_REC_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	An error occurred during RCP recovery.  The config file could not
	be opened to check the open status of a database which had log
	records logged during the current recovery window.

	The RCP could not determine whether recovery was needed or not on
	this database.

 System Status:
	The RCP will skip recovery on the database and that database will
	likely be marked inconsistent the next time it is accessed.

 Recommendation:
	Examine the error log to determine the reason for the error.  Check 
	the database location and the existence of the config file 
	(aaaaaaaa.cnf).  The database may need to be recovered from a 
	checkpoint.


E_DM9431_RCP_OPENDB_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	An error occurred during RCP recovery.  The database could not
	be opened to perform recovery processing.

 System Status:
	The RCP will skip recovery on the database, and that database will
	be marked inconsistent at the end of recovery processing.

 Recommendation:
	Examine the error log to determine the reason for the error.  Check 
	the database location and the existence of the config file 
	(aaaaaaaa.cnf).  The database may need to be recovered from a 
	checkpoint.

E_DM9440_SD_BIND:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0s - database name
	%1s - table name
	%2s - physical pathname
	%3s - physical filename
	%4d - error returned by SDbind()

 Explanation:
	The server called the host OS to initialize a Smart Disk scan,
	and an unexpected error occurred.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	If no I/O or host OS error is apparent, report the error as a bug.


E_DM9441_DM2U_FILE_CREATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	During a DDL operation, the server was creating new files associated
	with a new table or version of an existing table.

	An error occurred which prevents the file or files from being created.

	This message is issued when an internal error is detected within
	the dm2u_file_create() function.  It is a traceback message, and
	there should be previous error messages in the error log giving more
	detail on the specific problem encountered.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for previous errors to determine whether
	corrective user actions can be taken.


E_DM9442_REPLACE_COMPRESS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d	- return length of compressed old row data.
	%1d	- return length of compressed new row data.
	%2d	- byte at which original old and new rows were found to differ.
	%3d	- full length of old row.
	%4d	- full length of new row.
	%5d	- flag which indicates whether full compression was used on
		  the old row (via trace point DM902).

 Explanation:
	During the logging of a replace operation, a compressed replace record
	was formed by calculating the differing bytes between the old and
	new tuples.

	The replace log routine recognized inconsistent data returned from the
	routine which builds the compressed log record.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Report the error to Ingres Corporation technical support.  Save the 
	error log as well as any server trace file to assist in debugging 
	the problem.

	Workarounds may be achieved by searching for other ways to replace
	the record - perhaps by replacing fewer or extra columns in the
	record (especially those columns at the front or end of the row) and
	then fixing the record to its desired value after a successful replace.
	If trace point DM902 is in use, disable this trace point.


E_DM9443_DMR_PREINIT_RECOVER:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	none

 Explanation:
	During the RCP recovery initialization, the RCP adopts ownership
	of each lock list belonging to transactions marked as needing
	recovery.  After adopting ownership, the RCP looks for locks on
	the database config files or core catalog pages.  These locks must
	be released to ensure that the opendb requests by the RCP will
	succeed.

	This error occurred either in the LKcreate_list call to establish
	ownership of the lock list, the LKshow calls to examine the types
	of locks held by the transaction or an LKrelease call to release
	the config or catalog locks.

	Previous error messages should indicate more about the error.

 System Status:
	The RCP will fail and recovery will be halted.

 Recommendation:
	Report the error to Ingres Corporation technical support. Save the 
	system error log and the iircp.log to assist in debugging the problem. 
	Unless the iircp.log information suggests an environmental problem 
	that might be resolved the installation will likely not be 
	recoverable without reinitializing the logfile.


E_DM9444_DMD_DIR_NOT_PRESENT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	none

 Explanation:
	During rollforwarddb we have been unable to restore the config file.
      This appears to be because the data directory for the DB is absent.

 System Status:
	The rollforward will fail

 Recommendation:
	Report the error to Ingres Corporation technical support. The 
	system error log information may suggest an environmental problem 
	that might be resolved. Check by hand if the directory is present.


E_DM9445_DMR_ROW_CVT_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c - database name
      %1c - table name
      %2c - table owner

 Explanation:
      This is an internal debugging message. It documents a serious
      problem in converting a row. As part of Add and Drop column
	the row image is formatted. The tuple record as returned from
	disk is converted to the current format based on the add/drop
	attribute. Cumulative total of active column lengths exceed 
	the row width as detailed in the iirelation for the table.


E_DM9446_RCP_NO_SVDB_LOCK:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9447_RCP_SVDB_LOCK_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9448_DM2F_NO_DISK_SPACE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9449_DMD_CHECK:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c     - database name
      %1c	- database owner

 Explanation:
      An error occurred during RCP recovery for a secondary index.
      The recovery continued and completed successfully however
      the database was marked inconsistent because it contains
      inconsistent secondary index(s).


 System Status:
	The RCP started successfully however the database has been marked
	inconsistent because it contains inconsistent secondary index(s).

 Recommendation:
	Please save the RCP log file and the error log, and contact
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support for assistance in debugging 
	and resolving this problem.
	Please check the iircp.log file for additional information.
	If recovery completes successfully, you may choose to force the
	database consistent, then drop and recreate the inconsistent index.
	Alternatively, you can restore the database from a checkpoint.
	In both cases, a new checkpoint should be taken for this database.


E_DM944A_RCP_DBINCONSISTENT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c     - index name
      %1c	- index owner

 Explanation:
      An error occurred during RCP recovery for a secondary index(s).

 System Status:
	RCP recovery will continue, however subsequent log records for this
	index will be ignored. This index will be marked inconsistent by 
	the recovery process. The database will also be marked inconsistent.
 
 Recommendation:
	Please save the RCP log file and the error log, and contact
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support for assistance in debugging 
	and resolving this problem.
	Please check the iircp.log file for additional information.
	If recovery completes successfully, you may choose to force the
	database consistent, then drop and recreate the inconsistent index.

E_DM9507_DMXE_RESUME:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9508_DMXE_TRAN_INFO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0x     - logging system transaction handle
	%1x     - locking system locklist handle
	%2x.%3x - logging system transaction ID
	%4x     - database ID number
	%5c     - database name

 Explanation:
	This message indicates that a transaction abort error has occurred. The
	transaction abort processing failed, and the transaction could not be
	passed to the dmfrcp process for pass-abort processing. This message
	provides precise information about the transaction whose abort failed.

 System Status:
	This message will be followed in the error log by E_DMF029. The server
	will then be shut down to allow the dmfrcp process to perform server
	failure recovery.

 Recommendation:
	Examine the error log, RCP log, and ii_dbms_log/iicrash.log files to
	determine the reason for the transaction abort failure. After the
	reason has been resolved, restart the server. If the problem cannot be
	diagnosed from the information in the error logs, save all error logs
	and contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support for assistance.


E_DM9509_DMXE_PASS_ABORT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0x, %1x - transaction ID

 Explanation:
	This message indicates that a problem occurred in the rollback of a 
	transaction and that recovery of the transaction has been assigned to
	the RCP (dmfrcp). If the RCP fails to properly recover the transaction,
	the database will be marked inconsistent.

 	The reason for the PASS ABORT should be noted in the error log. 

 System Status:
	The server stays up.  If the RCP successfully rolls back the 
	transaction, there will be no adverse consequences of this event.  
	(However, pass aborts are not expected, and the underlying problem
	noted in the error log should be corrected.)  If RCP transaction 
	recovery fails, the database will be marked inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	If the problem persists, contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

E_DM9621_DMVE_BAD_BEFORE_IMAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9622_DMVE_DMU:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred aborting a DMU operation.  The backout algorithm
	involves logging an ABORT_SAVE record when the DM0L_DMU record is
	encountered.  An error was encountered while processing the DM0L_DMU
	operation.

	There should be a previous log record giving further details on what
	went wrong.

	If this error occurs in the DBMS server, the server will signal the
	recovery system to abort the transaction.  If this error occurs in the
	recovery system (RCP), then the database will be marked inconsistent.

 System Status:
	The system was not able to recover the open transaction in the database.
	If RCP is unable to recover the transaction, the database will be marked
	inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for the exact reason for the failure.  There should
	be a previous log record giving more detail on the error.  Check the
	RCP log for further information on the state of the system when this
	error occurred.


E_DM9623_DMVE_FSWAP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred aborting an FSWAP operation. The backout algorithm
	involves renaming the files back to their original versions.

	There should be a previous log record giving further details on what
	went wrong.

	If this error occurs in the DBMS server, the server will signal the
	recovery system to abort the transaction.  If this error occurs in the
	recovery system (RCP), then the database will be marked inconsistent.

 System Status:
	The system was not able to recover the open transaction in the database.
	If RCP is unable to recover the transaction, the database will be marked
	inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for the exact reason for the failure.  There should
	be a previous log record giving more detail on the error.  Check the
	RCP log for further information on the state of the system when this
	error occurred.


E_DM9624_DMVE_SBIPAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred processing System Catalog Before Image.  The backout
	algorithm involves replacing the existing page with the Before Image
	copy.

	There should be a previous log record giving further details on what
	went wrong.

	System Catalog Before Images are only used during online checkpoint
	processing; thus, this message should occur only when processing the
	ONLINE DUMP information while restoring to a checkpoint.

 System Status:
	The rollforwarddb will abort.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for the exact reason for the failure.  There should
	be a previous log record giving more detail on the error.  If there
	is a correctable system status, the rollforwarddb can be retried. If the
	problem is a corruption in the checkpoint information, then this
	checkpoint cannot be applied.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred processing an update overflow chain log record.

	This message is used to give a traceback of the program flow following
	an internal DMF error.  There should be previous error messages with

W_DM9660_DMVE_TABLE_OFFLINE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This is a warning status and is not actually intended to be logged.
	It is returned to indicate that a table referenced in a log record
	that is being applied is not included in the current recovery operation
	and needs not be recovered.

	This warning status is used only in partial recovery situations and
	is seen only by internal DMF routines.

 System Status:
	No change in system status.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_DM9661_DMVE_FIX_TABIO_RETRY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The DBMS recovery processing was unable to build a table descriptor
	in order to apply recovery to the database.

	During recovery, special table descriptors must be built to reference
	updated tables.  In order to build a new instance of such a descriptor,
	the recovery routines must get exclusive access to the table control
	block (TCB).

	If the recovery routine thinks it has been granted access to a TCB,
	only to find upon closer inspection that the TCB is busy, it will
	retry.  If several retries fail, this error will be generated.

 System Status:
	The recovery operation will fail, and the database will likely be
	marked inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for any related error messages that may give
	a reason for the failure.  If possible save the RCP log, the 
	error log, and the output from a logdump operation to assist 
	in resolving the problem.


E_DM9662_DMVE_FIX_TABIO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The DBMS recovery processing was unable to build a table descriptor
	in order to apply recovery to the database.

	This message is used to give a traceback of the program flow following
	an internal DMF error.  There should be previous error messages with
	more specific information on the error.

 System Status:
	The recovery operation will fail, and the database will likely be
	marked inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for the exact reason for the failure.  There should
	be a previous log record giving more detail on the error.  If possible
	save the RCP log, the error log, and the output from a logdump
	operation to assist in resolving the problem.

	The database will have to be restored from a checkpoint.


E_DM9664_DMVE_INFO_UNKNOWN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The DBMS recovery processing was unable to parse the current log record.

 System Status:
	The recovery operation will fail, and the database will likely be
	marked inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for any related error messages that may give
	a reason for the failure.  If possible save the RCP log, the 
	error log, and the output from a logdump operation to assist 
	in resolving the problem.


E_DM9665_PAGE_OUT_OF_DATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c     - table name
	%1c     - table owner
	%2d     - page number
	%3x     - page status
	%4d,%5d - page LSN
	%6d,%7d - log record LSN

 Explanation:
	During Page Oriented Recovery, there is a dependence upon
	pages being in exactly the state expected during undo and rollforward
	recovery.

	Page states are tracked by their LSNs.  An LSN is a unique log record
	identifier and is usually equivalent to the Log Address of the record.
	Whenever a page is updated, the LSN of the log record that describes
	the update is written to the page.  The LSN, therefore, indicates the
	the chronological state of the page.

	A page with an LSN less than that of an associated log record is in a 
	state PREVIOUS to when the logged update was applied.  That is to say,
	the update HAS NOT been applied to the page.

	A page with an LSN greater or equal to that of an associated log record
	must have had the update applied to it.

	During undo recovery, the page LSN must be at least equal to that of
	the log record LSN so that the update can be un-applied.  If it is
	not, then updates to the page must have been lost and not restored
	during redo processing.

	During rollforward recovery, the page state is expected to always be
	previous to the log records being applied.  If it is not, then the
	database must not have been properly restored to a valid checkpoint.

 System Status:
	During undo recovery, the operation will fail, and the database may
	be marked inconsistent. 

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for any related error messages that may give
	a reason for the failure.  If possible save the RCP log, the 
	error log, and the output from a logdump operation to assist 
	in resolving the problem.


E_DM9666_PAGE_LSN_MISMATCH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Error during page recovery -- page LSN does not match the log record
	being recovered.

	This message is used to give a traceback of the program flow following
	an internal DMF error.  There should be previous error messages with
	more specific information on the error.

 System Status:
	The recovery operation will fail, and the database will likely be
	marked inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for the exact reason for the failure.  There should
	be a previous log record giving more detail on the error.  If possible
	save the RCP log, the error log, and the output from a logdump
	operation to assist in resolving the problem.

	The database will have to be restored from a checkpoint.


E_DM9667_NOPARTIAL_RECOVERY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	During a partial recovery operation, a log record was encountered that
	cannot be recovered in a partial recovery mode.  This operation can
	only be recovered when all data locations of the table are available.

 System Status:
	Recovery of this table will no longer be performed.  At the completion
	of the current partial recovery operation, recovery must be restarted
	on this table, and all data locations of the table must be included
	in the recovered dataset.

 Recommendation:
	Restart recovery on the indicated table.


E_DM9668_TABLE_NOT_RECOVERED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d,%1d	- table ID

 Explanation:
	During a partial recovery operation, a log record was encountered that
	cannot be recovered in a partial recovery mode.  This operation can
	only be recovered when all data locations of the table are available.

 System Status:
	Recovery of this table will no longer be performed.  At the completion
	of the current partial recovery operation, recovery must be restarted
	on this table, and all data locations of the table must be included
	in the recovered dataset.

 Recommendation:
	Restart recovery on the indicated table.


E_DM9669_DMVE_BTUNDO_CHECK:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred during btree undo recovery.

	Some btree operations must perform special non-Page Oriented Recovery
	where logical searches of the btree index must be done.  An error
	was encountered during one of these operations.

	This message is used to give a traceback of the program flow following
	an internal DMF error.  There should be previous error messages with
	more specific information on the error.

 System Status:
	The recovery operation will fail, and the database will likely be
	marked inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for the exact reason for the failure.  There should
	be a previous log record giving more detail on the error.  If possible
	save the RCP log, the error log, and the output from a logdump
	operation to assist in resolving the problem.

	The database will have to be restored from a checkpoint.


E_DM966A_DMVE_KEY_MISMATCH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - page BID - page number
	%4d - page BID - line number
	%5c - page type (INDEX or LEAF)
	%6d - log BID - page number
	%7d - log BID - line number

 Explanation:
	During a btree recovery action, a btree key was looked up in the
	current database in order to either delete or update it as per the
	log record recovery algorithm.

	The key was found and compared with the logged key value and was
	found to not match.  Due to the repeating history qualities of
	DBMS recovery, the database should always be in a predictable
	state.

	When this error occurs, recovery is not halted.  Since the logged
	row was found (even though it did not exactly match), recovery
	processing continues in the hope that the problem was localized
	to the key/row in question and that applying the recovery action
	brings the database back to the expected state.

	(This message is followed by a second message, DM999B_DMVE_KEY_MISMATCH,
	which gives further details).

 System Status:
	Recovery will continue and, barring any other errors, the database
	will be brought to a consistent state.

 Recommendation:
	Report the error to Ingres Corporation Technical Support, since 
	this is an unexpected recovery situation.  Also use verifydb to 
	check the consistency of the btree index.


E_DM966B_DMVE_KEY_MISMATCH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page key length
	%1d - log record key length
	%2d - page TID - page number
	%3d - page TID - line number
	%4d - log record TID - page number
	%5d - log record TID - line number
	%6d - recovery action (undo, redo, do)

 Explanation:
	This is a continuation message for the above E_DM999A_DMVE_KEY_MISMATCH
	which gives further information about the key mismatch.

 System Status:
	Recovery will continue and, barring any other errors, the database
	will be brought to a consistent state.

 Recommendation:
	Report the error to Ingres Corporation Technical Support, since 
	this is an unexpected recovery situation.  Also use verifydb to 
	check the consistency of the btree index.


E_DM966C_DMVE_TUPLE_MISMATCH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - page TID - page number
	%4d - page TID - line number
	%5d - page row length
	%6d - log record row length
	%7d - recovery action (undo, redo, do)

 Explanation:
	During a recovery action, a tuple key was looked up in the
	current database in order to either delete or update it as per the
	log record recovery algorithm.

	The row was found and compared with the logged row value and was
	found to not match.  Due to the repeating history qualities of
	DBMS recovery, the database should always be in a predictable
	state.

	When this error occurs, recovery is not halted.  Since the logged
	row was found (even though it did not exactly match), recovery
	processing continues in the hope that the problem was localized
	to the key/row in question and that applying the recovery action
	brings the database back to the expected state.

 System Status:
	Recovery will continue and, barring any other errors, the database
	will be brought to a consistent state.

 Recommendation:
	Report the error to Ingres Corporation Technical Support, since 
	this is an unexpected recovery situation.  Also use verifydb to 
	check the consistency of the table.


E_DM966D_DMVE_ROW_MISSING:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - page TID - page number
	%4d - page TID - line number
	%5d - status from page access routine

 Explanation:
	During a recovery action, a row was looked up in the current database
	in order to either delete or update it as per the log record recovery
	algorithm.

	The updated page was found, but the row was not present on the
	page or was inaccessible.  Due to the repeating history qualities of
	DBMS recovery, the database should always be in a predictable
	state.

	The recovery operation cannot continue, since the row to update cannot
	be accessed.

 System Status:
	Recovery will halt on this database.

 Recommendation:
	Check for preceding errors in the error log, and check the RCP log for
	other information.  This database may need to be restored from a
	checkpoint.


E_DM966E_DMVE_ROW_OVERLAP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - page TID - page number
	%4d - page TID - line number

 Explanation:
	During a recovery action, a row was being inserted into the database
	in order to redo a delete or update operation.

	The updated page was found, but a row was found to already be present
	at the logged position.  Due to the repeating history qualities of
	DBMS recovery, the database should always be in a predictable
	state.

	The recovery operation cannot continue, since the row cannot be inserted
	into the logged slot.

 System Status:
	Recovery will halt on this database.

 Recommendation:
	Check for preceding errors in the error log, and check the RCP log for
	other information.  This database may need to be restored from a
	checkpoint.


E_DM966F_DMVE_BTOVFL_NOROOM:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - overflow leaf page number
	%4d - LSN of last update to page (high portion)
	%5d - LSN of last update to page (low portion)
	%6x - number of key entries on the page
	%7x - maximum keys per page
	%8x - size of new key entry (including TID portion)

 Explanation:
	During recovery of a delete operation, a deleted row was being
	put back into a btree table.  The row had originally been deleted
	from a leaf or overflow page.  Upon reading that leaf page during
	rollback, it was found to have been affected by later split actions.

	It was verified that the overflow page was still the proper place
	at which to insert the key, but it was found to have insufficient
	space.

	The current btree recovery algorithms sometimes require logical
	searches to find the page at which to insert keys, but never
	expect to have to allocate new space.  It is an error to find
	insufficient space on the proper leaf or chain.

	When this error is encountered, we continue and perform a logical
	search for space at which to put the new key in the hope that
	we can avoid failing the recovery operation and marking the database
	inconsistent.

 System Status:
	Recovery will continue on this database but may fail soon after
	with other errors on this table.

 Recommendation:
	Check for preceding and subsequent errors in the error log, and 
	check the RCP log for other information.  Run verifydb on the
	table following recovery to check its consistency.


E_DM9670_DMVE_BTUNDO_WARN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	During recovery of a btree operation, an updated page was found
	to have been effected by a split operation subsequent to the
	logged update.

	An error was encountered attempting to validate that the logged
	page number is still the proper page to which to apply the undo
	operation.

	When this error is encountered, we continue and perform a logical
	search for space at which to put the new key in the hope that
	we can avoid failing the recovery operation and marking the database
	inconsistent.

 System Status:
	Recovery will continue on this database but may fail soon after
	with other errors on this table.

 Recommendation:
	Check for preceding and subsequent errors in the error log, and 
	check the RCP log for other information.  Run verifydb on the
	table following recovery to check its consistency.


E_DM9671_DMVE_BTUNDO_FAILURE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	During recovery of a btree operation, an updated page was found
	to have been effected by a split operation subsequent to the
	logged update.

	A logical search for the proper leaf to which to apply the
	undo action failed to find either the logged row or space to
	re-insert it.

	Recovery cannot proceed on this operation.

 System Status:
	Recovery will halt on this database.

 Recommendation:
	Check for preceding errors in the error log, and check the RCP log for
	other information.  This database may need to be restored from a
	checkpoint.


E_DM9672_DMVE_ALLOC_WRONGMAP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - allocated page number
	%4d - FMAP page number
	%5d - FMAP index number

 Explanation:
	During recovery of an allocate operation, the DM0L_ALLOC log record
	was found to be inconsistent, making recovery of the operation
	impossible.

	The logged FMAP index indicated that the FMAP page specified in
	the log record should not contain the free state information for
	the allocated page.

	Recovery cannot proceed on this operation.

 System Status:
	Recovery will halt on this database.

 Recommendation:
	Report the error to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.  Save 
	a logdump if at all possible.  The database will likely need to be 
	recovered using "rollforwarddb -e" to stop recovery before the bad 
	log record is encountered.


E_DM9673_DMVE_ALLOC_MAPSTATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - FMAP page number
	%4c - page state in FMAP - FREE or USED
	%5c - page state in Log Record - FREE or USED
	%6d - allocated page number
	%7x - page_stat field on allocated page (-1 if page not available)
	%8c - page state in FMAP - FREE or USED

 Explanation:
	During recovery of an allocate operation, the FMAP page state was
	found to not be in the expected state.  The page state was already
	in the same state that recovery processing intended to set it to.

	Due to the repeating history qualities of recovery, the database
	should always be in a predictable state.

	Since recovery is not prevented from proceeding (the database can
	be brought to the state that the log records direct it to), recovery
	proceeds.  However, the error may be an indicator that other parts
	of the database are not consistent with the logged state and that
	the integrity of the database is suspect.

	The logged table should be examined with verifydb when recovery is
	complete.

 System Status:
	Recovery will continue on the database and, unless other errors
	are encountered, the database will remain usable.

 Recommendation:
	Report the error to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.  Save 
	a logdump if at all possible.  Check the table using verifydb after 
	recovery completes.


E_DM9674_DMVE_PAGE_NOROOM:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - page TID - page number
	%4d - page TID - line number
	%5x - size of new row 

 Explanation:
	During a recovery action, a row was being inserted into the database
	in order to redo a delete or update operation.

	The updated page was found, but insufficient space was found on the
	page to reinsert the row.  Due to the repeating history qualities of
	recovery, the database should always be in a predictable
	state.

	The recovery operation cannot continue since the row cannot be inserted
	into the logged slot.

 System Status:
	Recovery will halt on this database.

 Recommendation:
	Check for preceding errors in the error log, and check the RCP log for
	other information.  This database may need to be restored from a
	checkpoint.


E_DM9675_DMVE_EXT_FHDR_STATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - FHDR page number
	%4d - FHDR page EOF value
	%5d - logged EOF value
	%6d - FHDR page FMAP count value
	%7d - logged FMAP count value

 Explanation:
	During recovery of an EXTEND operation, the FHDR page was found
	to not match the state expected.  Due to the repeating history 
	qualities of recovery, the database should always be in a 
	predictable state.

	can be restored to its expected state.  But the occurrence could
	indicate that other database objects are not in the expected state
	and that recovery will later fail.

 System Status:
	Recovery will continue on the database and, unless other errors
	are encountered, the database will remain usable.

 Recommendation:
	Report the error to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.  Save 
	a logdump if at all possible.  Check the table using verifydb after 
	recovery completes.

E_DM9831_ARCH_JWRITE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9832_ARCH_OBCLEAN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DM9833_ARCH_BACKUP_FAILURE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	The online checkpoint facility failed when the archiver (dmfacp) 
	encountered an error.  The online checkpoint facility depends on 
	the archiver to successfully function, in order to guarantee a 
	consistent checkpoint of the database.  This error occurred sometime 
	during the archiver processing during the online checkpoint.

	Consult both the error log and the ACP log file for more
	information concerning the cause of the failures.

 System Status:
	Online checkpoint processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	After addressing the error conditions detailed in the error log
	files, restart the online checkpoint.


E_DM9834_ARCH_OLPURGE_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.
 Explanation:
	The archiver was signaled to execute an online purge event --
	probably as part of an online checkpoint.  The archiver found
	that there were open transactions that spanned past the
	boundaries of the online purge window.

	The online purge protocols dictate that there be no active
	transactions when the purge is signaled and that no transactions
	span past the boundaries of the purge window.  That is, any
	transactions that have a BT record inside the purge window
	must have that transaction resolved within the purge window.

	This condition will cause the archiver to fail.

 System Status:
	Online checkpoint processing aborts.  The archiver is brought down.

 Recommendation:
	After addressing the error conditions detailed in the error log
	files, restart the archiver and retry the online checkpoint.


E_DM9835_ARCH_NEW_JNL_ENTRY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	When an online checkpoint is signaled on a journaled database,
	the journal history is not updated to indicate a new journal
	file until the SBACKUP record is encountered in the archiver.

	At this time, the archiver creates the new journal history entry
	and creates a new journal file.

	This error occurs when an error is encountered creating a new
	journal history entry.

	There should be previous error messages in the error log which
	gives a better indication of the exact error.

 System Status:
	Online checkpoint processing aborts.  The archiver will probably fail.

 Recommendation:
	After addressing the error conditions detailed in the error log
	files, restart the archiver and retry the online checkpoint.


E_DM9836_ARCH_MISMATCHED_ET:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0x, %1x - log file internal transaction ID (in hex)

 Explanation:
	This message is produced by the archiver when a very specific internal
	error has occurred: During its scanning of the log file's consistency
	point window, the archiver found an End Transaction record for a
	transaction which had no corresponding Begin Transaction record.

	This is a SERIOUS internal error in the transaction log file, and 
	means that the log file information for the indicated transaction 
	will be lost.

	The archiver must be restarted in a special fashion in order to
	proceed. Instructions for this are given in the mini-dump which the
	archiver produced.

 System Status:
	An archiver mini-dump has been produced and is contained in the ACP
	log file. This mini-dump contains problem determination information
	which is crucial to the diagnosis of this problem.

	After producing the mini-dump, the archiver will terminate. In order to
	restart the archiver properly, follow the instructions at the end of
	the archiver mini-dump.

 Recommendation:
	Please follow the instructions at the end of the archiver mini-dump in
	order to restart the archiver. Please report this problem to
	Technical Support and forward the archiver mini-dump 
	for their use in analyzing the problem.

	Once the archiver has been successfully restarted, please take an
	up-to-date checkpoint of every database which was in use at the time of
	the problem. This ensures that the databases will not need to depend on
	the possibly damaged journal files should rollforward be necessary in
	the future.


E_DM9837_ARCH_ET_CONTINUE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c     - value of II_ACP_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR
	%1x,%2x - transaction ID which was not journaled
	%3c     - database which contained this transaction
	%4c     - owner of the indicated database

 Explanation:
	This message is produced when the archiver acknowledges a request to
	continue processing after an internal log file error has occurred. The
	archiver will resume its activity of copying committed 
	transaction information to the transaction log file, but the indicated
	transaction's information was NOT copied to the indicated database's
	journal files, so the journal files are incomplete.

 System Status:
	Archiver processing continues, but the transaction indicated in the
	message was not archived, and the journals for the indicated database
	are incomplete.

 Recommendation:
	If you have not already done so, please report this problem to 
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support, as it indicates a severe 
	internal error in the transaction log which needs to be diagnosed 
	and repaired.

	Once the archiver finishes this processing, please take a checkpoint
	of the indicated database. You may want to take a checkpoint of ALL
	your databases which were in action at the time of this error,
	but only the database indicated in this message needs an immediate
	checkpoint; all other databases are unaffected by this problem.


E_DM9838_ARCH_DB_BAD_LA:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued by the dmfacp process when it detects an internal
	error. The archiver keeps track of each database's archiving activity
	in a special file known as the database configuration file (named
	aaaaaaaa.cnf). In this file, the archiver stores the log address of the
	last log record which was copied to the journals for this database.
	Transaction log addresses are ever-increasing 8-byte integers, and 
	the log address which the archiver reads from the configuration 
	file should never exceed the log address in the current log file. 
	If it does, the archiver issues this message and stops processing.

	The most likely reason for encountering this error is that the log
	file was re-initialized and the system time was erroneous, resulting
	in log file addresses which were not ever-increasing.

 System Status:
	The archiver stops processing. Detailed information about the database
	that encountered this error and the log address which was erroneous
	is logged in the ACP log file.

 Recommendation:
	Run infodb for this database, and note the values which infodb
	displays for the last log address journaled for this database. If this
	is a VAX/VMS Cluster installation, also note the last log address
	information for each cluster node. Next, run logstat, and note the
	current log file EOF position. Observe that the last log address value
	exceeds the current EOF.

	Now contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support and report this problem. You will
	be given advice on how to repair the problem. (Internal note: The best
	recovery action is probably to patch the jnl_la or cnode_la in the
	config file back down to the current EOF, then to IMMEDIATELY take
	a checkpoint of the database.)


E_DM9839_ARCH_JNL_SEQ_ZERO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Database journal files are named according to a numbering scheme in
	which a sequence number is assigned to each journal file, beginning
	with number 1. Sequence number 0 is special and indicates internally
	that no database journaling has been performed. Any attempt to create
	journal file sequence number 0 is invalid, and indicates a corrupt
	database configuration file.

 System Status:
	The archiver issues this message and terminates processing. The database
	is NOT journaled, and journal number zero is NOT created.

 Recommendation:
	Please report the corrupt database problem to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.
	You will be asked to provide the ACP log file, so please have that file
	handy. Also, please run infodb on the database in question (the name of
	the database can be found in the ACP log file) and have the infodb
	results available, as they should indicate what the precise problem is
	with the database configuration file. Finally, obtain a directory
	listing of the current contents of the II_JOURNAL location for this
	database.

	Ingres Corporation Technical Support personnel will advise you on how to repair
	the database configuration file. (Internal note: After analyzing the
	infodb report and the current journal directory contents, it should be
	clear what the journal file sequence number ought to be. Patch
	cnf_jnl->jnl_fil_seq to contain the current highest journal file
	sequence number and restart the archiver -- it should then increment
	the value and create the new journal file).


E_DM983A_ARCH_OPEN_JNL_ZERO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Database journal files are named according to a numbering scheme in
	which a sequence number is assigned to each journal file, beginning
	with number 1. Sequence number 0 is special and indicates internally
	that no database journaling has been performed. Any attempt to open
	journal file sequence number 0 is invalid, and indicates a corrupt
	database configuration file.

 System Status:
	The archiver issues this message and terminates processing. The database
	is NOT journaled, and journal number zero is NOT opened.

 Recommendation:
	Please report the corrupt database problem to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.
	You will be asked to provide the ACP log file, so please have that file
	handy. Also, please run infodb on the database in question (the name of
	the database can be found in the ACP log file) and have the infodb
	results available, as they should indicate what the precise problem is
	with the database configuration file. Finally, obtain a directory
	listing of the current contents of the II_JOURNAL location for this
	database.

	Ingres Corporation Technical Support personnel will advise you on how to recover
	from this problem. (Internal note: The archiver contains code which
	detects journal file sequence 0 as meaning "no journal file yet exists,
	need to create a new one." The problem may well not be in the config
	file, but rather in the logic for detecting and handling this condition)


E_DM983B_ARCH_EXIT_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	During archiver shutdown, the archiver exit command script
	is run just prior to process termination.

	This error is raised if a problem is encountered trying to
	execute the command script.  Previous messages in the log file
	should give more detailed information about the specific error
	encountered.

 System Status:
	The archiver shutdown will have continued.  The exit command
	script was not run.

 Recommendation:
	Check permissions and access to the exit command script.
	Check the ACP log file for more information on the error.


E_DM983C_ARCH_EXIT_CMD_OVFL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	During archiver shutdown, the archiver exit command script
	is run just prior to process termination.

	This error is raised if the command line string to execute
	the script overflows the local command buffer of 256 bytes.

	This most likely will be caused if the path to II_FILES is
	too long.

	The ACP log file should indicate the desired command-line string.

 System Status:
	The archiver shutdown will have continued.  The exit command
	script was not run.

 Recommendation:
	Check the ACP log for the desired command-line string.  Consider
	a shorter path to the root directory.


E_DM983D_ARCH_JNL_DISABLE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	This database has had journaling disabled through the alterdb
	command "alterdb -disable_journaling".  Presumably, this was
	to get around some journaling problem which prevented records
	from being moved from the log file to the journal files.

	This message is written when the archiver encounters journal
	work for a database which has had journaling disabled.

	It does not indicate an error condition, but does indicate that
	the journal files for the database do not hold all the journal
	records to describe the current state of the database.

 System Status:
	No disruption of system work -- no errors will be returned to the
	user.  The database indicated remains accessible, but updates
	to journaled tables are not actually being reflected in the
	database journal files.

 Recommendation:
	Eventually, the user will probably want to re-enable journaling
	on the database via ckpdb.


E_DM983E_ACP_DBID_INFO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - database ID encountered
	%1d - max legal database ID
	%2x - original logging system ID
	%3d - log record type

 Explanation:
	This is an internal debugging message which is issued by the archiver
	process in order to record the precise parameters which caused the
	archiver to crash. This message will be followed by additional messages
	describing the archiver crash. This message, together with the other
	archiver messages in the error log, and together with the ACP log file,
	should be saved for reporting this problem to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

 System Status:
	The archiver will soon terminate. Other archiver messages in the
	error log will give additional instructions about the precise archiver
	crash.

 Recommendation:
	Examine the other archiver messages in the error log for information
	about how to restart the archiver process.


E_DM983F_ARCH_BAD_DBID:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message indicates that the archiver has encountered an internal
	logging system protocol error. This message is issued to aid in the
	diagnosis of the internal protocol violation.

 System Status:
	The archiver will soon terminate. Other archiver messages in the
	error log will give additional instructions about the precise archiver
	crash.

 Recommendation:
	Please contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support to report 
	this problem. Please save the error log and the ACP log 
	file for use by Technical Support in problem diagnosis. Examine 
	the other archiver messages in the error log for information about 
	how to restart the archiver process.

	error log will give additional instructions about the precise archiver
	crash.

 Recommendation:
	Please contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support to report 
	this problem. Please save the error log and the ACP log 
	file for use by Technical Support in problem diagnosis. Examine 
	the other archiver messages in the error log for information 
	about how to restart the archiver process.


E_DM9841_ARCH_BAD_DBID:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message indicates that the archiver has encountered an internal
	logging system protocol error. This message is issued to aid in the
	diagnosis of the internal protocol violation.

 System Status:

	crash.

 Recommendation:
	Please contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support to report this 
	problem. Please save the error log and the ACP log file for use by 
	Technical Support in problem diagnosis. Examine the other archiver 
	messages in the error log for information about how to restart 
	the archiver process.


E_DM9842_ARCH_SOC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message indicates that the archiver has encountered an internal
	error during Start of Cycle processing.  

 System Status:
	The archiver will soon terminate. Other archiver messages in the
	error log will give additional instructions about the precise archiver
	crash.

 Recommendation:
	Please contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support to report this 
	problem. Please save the error log and the ACP log file for use by 
	Technical Support in problem diagnosis.  Examine the other archiver 
	messages in **	the error log for information about how to restart 
	the archiver process.


E_DM9843_ARCH_COPY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message indicates that the archiver has encountered an internal
	error during Copy processing.

 System Status:
	The archiver will soon terminate. Other archiver messages in the
	error log will give additional instructions about the precise archiver
	crash.

 Recommendation:
	Please contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support to report this 
	problem. Please save the error log and the ACP log file for use by 
	Technical Support in problem diagnosis.  Examine the other archiver 
	messages in the error log for information about how to restart the 
	archiver process.


E_DM9844_ARCH_EOC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message indicates that the archiver has encountered an internal
	error during End of Cycle processing.  

 System Status:
	The archiver will soon terminate. Other archiver messages in the
	error log will give additional instructions about the precise archiver
	crash.

 Recommendation:
	Please contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support to report this 
	problem. Please save the error log and the ACP log file for use by 
	Technical Support in problem diagnosis. Examine the other archiver 
	messages in the error log for information about how to restart the 
	archiver process.


E_DM9845_ARCH_WINDOW:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:

	%0d,%1d,%2d - lower bound of database journal or dump window
	%3d,%4d,%5d - lower bound of archive window

 Explanation:
	The logging system keeps information about each active database
	in the system, including the window of the log file which contains
	journal or dump records not yet processed by the archiver.

	The logging system also maintains system archive window values which
	form a union of all individual database journal and dump windows.

	This error is logged if the archiver finds a database with a journal
	or dump window that precedes the system archive window.

	The archiver will attempt to fix the problem by archiving the
	ambiguous portion of the log file.  Since the individual database
	config files record the portions of the log file that have already
	been archived, there should never be any danger of reprocessing
	journal records.

 System Status:
	The archiver sets its start address back to the database window
	and attempts to continue normally.  It is possible that this error
	will be preceded by a LOG_READ_EOF error if the logging system has
	also incorrectly moved the log file BOF up past this inconsistent
	journal/dump window.

 Recommendation:
	Please contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support to report this
	problem. Please save the error log and the ACP log file for use by 
	Technical Support in problem diagnosis.


E_DM9846_ARCH_WINDOW:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d,%1d,%2d - lower bound of archive window
	%3d,%4d,%5d - log file BOF
	%6d,%7d,%8d - log file EOF

 Explanation:
	The logging system maintains system archive window values which
	form a union of all individual database journal and dump windows.

	This error is logged if the archiver finds that the archive
	window lies outside the boundaries of the log file.

	The archiver will attempt to fix the problem by archiving the
	ambiguous portion of the log file.  Since the individual database
	config files record the portions of the log file that have already
	been archived, there should never be any danger of reprocessing
	journal records.

 System Status:
	The archiver will stop itself.  It is possible that this error
	will be preceded by a LOG_READ_EOF error if the logging system has
	also incorrectly moved the log file BOF up past this inconsistent
	journal/dump window.

 Recommendation:
	Shut down and restart the installation.

	Please contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support to report this 
	problem. Please save the error log and the ACP log file for use by 
	Technical Support in problem diagnosis.


E_DM9850_ACP_NORMAL_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The archiver has terminated upon request of the logging system.
	The logging system will direct the archiver to shut down as part
	of normal installation shutdown proceedings.

	This message is written by the archiver as part of its shutdown
	protocols.  It does not indicate an error in archive processing.

 System Status:
	The archiver has exited, and archive processing has stopped.
	Presumably, since the archiver has been directed to shut down, the
	rest of the installation is also down.

 Recommendation:
	None required -- this is not an abnormal situation.


E_DM9851_ACP_INITIALIZE_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred during archiver startup and the archiver
	could not be initialized.

	The ACP log file should contain more detailed information about
	the specific errors encountered.

 System Status:
	The archiver has not started up.  The installation may still be
	active, but no archiving will be done.

 Recommendation:
	Check the ACP log file for the specific error encountered.  Check
	permissions on the DBMS directories and the transaction log file.  Make
	sure the ACP is running with the appropriate privileges and quotas
	indicated in the Getting Started Guide.


E_DM9852_ACP_JNL_WRITE_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name on which journal write failed
	%1c - journal directory to which write was attempted
	%2c - "write" or "create", indicates action attempted

 Explanation:
	The archiver could not write journal records for the indicated database
	to the journal files.  This is probably due to lack of disk space on
	the journal device.

	The error may be encountered during an attempt to create a new
	journal file or extend an old one.  Journal files are numbered
	sequentially in the database journal location, with access done
	only to the highest number file.

	This error will be given on any write failure to the journal file
	due to the inability on some systems to distinguish between a
	write failure and an allocate failure; however, most occurrences of
	this error will occur during space allocation operations.

 System Status:
	Archiver processing will cease and will not continue until restarting
	the archiver.  Database operations can continue until all log file
	space is used up.  At that time, all database update operations
	will be stalled until the archiver can be restarted to free up
	log file space.

 Recommendation:
	Free up disk space on the indicated journal device and restart the
	archiver process.


E_DM9853_ACP_RESOURCE_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - type of resource failure: "logging", "locking", or "memory".
	%1c - specific logging/locking resource to be increased.

 Explanation:
	The archiver could not allocate a resource necessary for processing.

	Types of resource failure are:

	  Logging - Could not start transaction for archive processing.
	            Logging system configuration should be altered to
	            increase maximum number of concurrent transactions.
	  Locking - Could not allocate lock-list for archive processing.
	            Locking system configuration should be altered to
	            increase the number of lock-lists.
	  Memory  - Could not allocate memory for archive processing.
	            This may be due to process quotas or actual system
	            resources.  On VMS systems, quotas on the ACP should
	            be examined to determine if they can be increased
	            (See the utility script RUN_ACP.COM).  If
	            system memory is exhausted, the system load may
	            need to be decreased.

	Since most resource exhaustions are temporary and occur at peak
	loads, the archiver can often be restarted immediately without
	actually having to reconfigure the system.  Some resources may
	be recovered by decreasing the amount of concurrent activity to
	the DBMS.

 System Status:
	Archive processing will cease and will not continue until restarting
	the archiver.  Database operations can continue until all log file
	space is used up.  At that time, all database update operations
	will be stalled until the archiver can be restarted to free up
	log file space.

 Recommendation:
	Examine the ACP log file to determine the type of resource failure.
	After the problem is resolved, restart the archiver process.


E_DM9854_ACP_JNL_ACCESS_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name on which journal access failed
	%1c - journal directory to which access was attempted

 Explanation:
	The archiver could not open/write/close journal records for the
	indicated database to the journal files.

	This error may indicate a permission or quota problem.  The ACP
	log file should be reviewed for detailed information specific to the
	problem just encountered.

 System Status:
	Archive processing will cease and will not continue until restarting
	the archiver.  Database operations can continue until all log file
	space is used up.  At that time, all database update operations
	will be stalled until the archiver can be restarted to free up
	log file space.

 Recommendation:
	Review the ACP log file to determine the cause of the failure.
	After the problem is resolved, restart the archiver process.


E_DM9855_ACP_LG_ACCESS_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The archiver encountered an error from a call to the logging system or
	in an attempt to read/write transaction log file records.

	This may indicate a problem with the transaction log file or with the
	information in the logging system.  First verify that permissions
	and quotas for the archiver are set correctly.

	If the problem is with logging system information, then restarting
	the installation should clear up the problem.  If the problem persists,
	then it could be a inconsistency in the log file, which may require
	reinitialization to clear up.

 System Status:
	Archive processing will cease and will not continue until restarting
	the archiver.  Database operations can continue until all log file
	space is used up.  At that time, all database update operations
	will be stalled until the archiver can be restarted to free up
	log file space.

 Recommendation:
	Review the ACP log file to determine the cause of the failure.
	After the problem is resolved, restart the archiver process.


E_DM9856_ACP_DB_ACCESS_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name on which access failed

 Explanation:
	The archiver could not open/close/write the database config file
	for the specified database.

	This may indicate a permission or quota problem -- or it could be
	caused by the nonexistence of the config file.

	Most database-specific problems can be bypassed by disabling
	logging on the failing database in order to get archiver processing
	going, then re-enabling journal processing after the archiver
	has skipped over the troublesome area of journal processing.
	This can be done using "alterdb -disable_journaling".  Note that
	this will cause journal records for the database to be discarded,
	so they cannot be used in auditdb or rollforwarddb processing;
	the database will no longer be journaled.  Journaling should be
	re-enabled as soon as possible by issuing a new checkpoint: "ckpdb +j".

 System Status:
	Archive processing will cease and will not continue until restarting
	the archiver.  Database operations can continue until all log file
	space is used up.  At that time, all database update operations
	will be stalled until the archiver can be restarted to free up
	log file space.

 Recommendation:
	Review the ACP log file to determine the cause of the failure.
	After the problem is resolved, restart the archiver process.


E_DM9857_ACP_JNL_RECORD_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name on which access failed

 Explanation:
	A journaling error was encountered while attempting to process
	a journal record for the specified database.  This probably indicates
	an inconsistency in journal information for that database.

	This may be an invalid or unrecognized type of log record, or
	a log record not associated with a transaction known to the
	archiver (i.e., the BT/ET pair for this transaction were not found).

	Most database-specific problems can be bypassed by disabling
	logging on the failing database in order to get archiver processing
	going, then re-enabling journal processing after the archiver
	has skipped over the troublesome area of journal processing.
	This can be done using "alterdb -disable_journaling".  Note that
	this will cause journal records for the database to be discarded,
	so that they cannot be used in auditdb or rollforward processing;
	the database will no longer be journaled.  Journaling should be
	re-enabled as soon as possible by issuing a new checkpoint: "ckpdb +j".

 System Status:
	Archive processing will cease and will not continue until restarting
	the archiver.  Database operations can continue until all log file
	space is used up.  At that time, all database update operations
	will be stalled until the archiver can be restarted to free up
	log file space.

 Recommendation:
	Review the ACP log file to determine the cause of the failure.
	After the problem is resolved, restart the archiver process.


E_DM9858_ACP_ONLINE_BACKUP_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name on which access failed

 Explanation:
	The archiver failed due to an error in online checkpoint processing.

	Virtually all errors encountered during online backup are mapped
	to this error.  The problem may have occurred accessing II_DUMP,
	database or logging system information, or be due to resource
	or quota limitations.

	The ACP log file should give more detailed information as to
	what operation failed.

	Usually, the archiver can be restarted immediately, since the
	online backup operation will have failed.  When archive processing
	continues, DUMP processing will not be done, as the checkpoint
	will no longer be in progress.

	If the checkpoint error was really an indication of bad archiver
	problems that were not necessarily related to checkpoint processing
	(the error just happened to be encountered in a checkpoint-specific
	routine), then attempts to restart the archiver may also fail.

 System Status:
	Archive processing will cease and will not continue until restarting
	the archiver.  Database operations can continue until all log file
	space is used up.  At that time, all database update operations
	will be stalled until the archiver can be restarted to free up
	log file space.

	The requested checkpoint operation will have returned with an
	error due to the archiver termination.

 Recommendation:
	Review the ACP log file to determine the cause of the failure.
	After the problem is resolved, restart the archiver process.
	Try to reissue the checkpoint command to backup the database.
	If the checkpoint operation continues to fail, then the database
	may not be able to be backed up until the problem is resolved.


E_DM9859_ACP_EXCEPTION_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An exception has forced the archiver to stop.  This will most likely
	represent a bug and should be reported as such to Ingres Corporation
	Technical Support.

	The ACP log file should be saved and, if possible, a logdump should be
	performed to gather information to use in tracking down the bug.

	Hopefully, the archiver can be restarted to continue processing.
	If the exception error continues, the installation should be restarted.
	If the exception still continues, then the error is probably being
	triggered by some condition in the log file itself.

	Inspecting the ACP log file may give a clue as to whether the
	exception occurs on processing of a particular database.  Most
	database-specific problems can be bypassed by temporarily disabling
	logging on the database to allow the archiver to move forward past
	the "bad" log records.  See the alterdb command for further information
	on this.  Note that journaling should be re-enabled as soon as possible,
	since the database is no longer protected by the journaling system
	after journaling is disabled.

	If the problem cannot be isolated to processing for a particular
	database, or if disabling journaling does not resolve the exception
	condition, then the transaction log file may need to be reinitialized
	to clear the condition.

 System Status:
	Archive processing will cease and will not continue until restarting
	the Archiver.  Database operations can continue until all log file
	space is used up.  At that time, all database update operations
	will be stalled until the archiver can be restarted to free up
	log file space.

 Recommendation:
	Review the ACP log file to determine the cause of the failure.
	After the problem is resolved, restart the archiver process.


E_DM985A_ACP_JNL_PROTOCOL_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The archiver encountered a log record or was given LG information
	that it did not understand, or did not think was consistent.

	This error will usually be triggered if the archiver reads a log record
	that it cannot match to any journaled database. This will most likely
	represent a  and should be reported as such to Ingres Corporation
	Technical Support.

	The ACP log file should be saved and, if possible, a logdump should be
	performed to gather information to use in tracking down the bug.

	Hopefully, the archiver can be restarted to continue processing.
	If the protocol error continues, the installation should be restarted.
	If the error still continues, then the error is probably being
	triggered by some condition in the log file itself.  In this case,
	the log file may need to be reinitialized to clear the condition.

 System Status:
	Archive processing will cease and will not continue until restarting
	the Archiver.  Database operations can continue until all log file
	space is used up.  At that time, all database update operations
	will be stalled until the archiver can be restarted to free up
	log file space.

 Recommendation:
	Review the ACP log file to determine the cause of the failure.
	After the problem is resolved, restart the archiver process.


E_DM985B_ACP_INTERNAL_ERROR_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The archiver encountered an internal error that prevents further
	processing. This will most likely represent a bug and should
	be reported as such to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

	The ACP log file should be saved and, if possible, a logdump should be
	performed to gather information to use in tracking down the bug.

	Hopefully, the archiver can be restarted to continue processing.
	If the protocol error continues, the installation should be restarted.
	If the error still continues, then the error is probably being
	triggered by some condition in the log file itself.  In this case,
	the log file may need to be reinitialized to clear the condition.

 System Status:
	Archive processing will cease and will not continue until restarting
	the Archiver.  Database operations can continue until all log file
	space is used up.  At that time, all database update operations
	will be stalled until the archiver can be restarted to free up
	log file space.

 Recommendation:
	Review the ACP log file to determine the cause of the failure.
	After the problem is resolved, restart the archiver process.


E_DM985C_ACP_DMP_WRITE_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name on which dump write failed
	%1c - dump directory to which write was attempted
	%2c - "write" or "create", indicates action attempted

 Explanation:
	The archiver could not write log records for the indicated database
	to the dump files.  This is probably due to lack of disk space on the
	dump device.

	The error may be encountered during an attempt to create a new
	dump file or extend an old one.  Dump files are numbered
	sequentially in the database journal location, with access done
	only to the highest number file.

	This error will be given on any write failure to the dump file
	due to the inability on some systems to distinguish between a
	write failure and an allocate failure; however, most occurrences of
	this error will occur during space allocation operations.

 System Status:
	Archive processing will cease and will not continue until restarting
	the Archiver.  Database operations can continue until all log file
	space is used up.  At that time, all database update operations
	will be stalled until the archiver can be restarted to free up
	log file space.

 Recommendation:
	Review the ACP log file to determine the cause of the failure.
	After the problem is resolved, restart the archiver process.


E_DM985D_ACP_ONLINE_DB_FATAL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c - database name

 Explanation:
      Dump processing failed for a database, most likely due to disk
      space limitations in the dump area of the database.  The Archiver
      log II_ACP.LOG will contain more information as to the cause.

 System Status:
      Archive processing will continue for other databases.  The online
      checkpoint for the database in error will fail.

 Recommendation:
      Review the Archiver Log to determine the cause of the failure.


E_DM985F_ACP_UNKNOWN_EXIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The archiver encountered an internal error that prevents further
	processing. This will most likely represent a bug and should
	be reported as such to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

	The ACP log file should be saved and, if possible, a logdump should be
	performed to gather information to use in tracking down the bug.

	Hopefully, the archiver can be restarted to continue processing.
	If the protocol error continues, the installation should be restarted.
	If the error still continues, then the error is probably being
	triggered by some condition in the log file itself.  In this case,
	the log file may need to be reinitialized to clear the condition.

 System Status:
	Archive processing will cease and will not continue until restarting
	the Archiver.  Database operations can continue until all log file
	space is used up.  At that time, all database update operations
	will be stalled until the archiver can be restarted to free up
	log file space.

 Recommendation:
	Review the ACP log file to determine the cause of the failure.
	After the problem is resolved, restart the archiver process.

E_DM9C04_BUFFER_LOCK_INFO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - page number
	%1d - table ID
	%2d - index ID
	%3c - database name
	%4x - buffer status bits
	%5d - high portion of actual lock value
	%6d - low portion of actual lock value
	%7d - high portion of expected lock value
	%8d - low portion of expected lock value
	%9x - internal locking system status code

 Explanation:
	An internal logic error has been detected by the DBMS server.
	When a cached database page is being validated by the server, the
	server queries the locking system for the current page version
	number to determine whether the cached copy is valid or not. For a
	page which is currently FIXED and therefore in use, the server expects
	that the cached copy is indeed the current version. If the locking
	system indicates that the wrong version is cached, an internal logic
	error must have occurred.

 System Status:
	The server is brought down immediately. Since this message indicates
	an internal logic error, processing cannot continue within the server.
	The RCP will perform recovery on any databases which were open by the
	server.

 Recommendation:
	Notify Ingres Corporation Technical Support. Please save the error 
	log, the RCP log file, and all other diagnostic information, as 
	this will be required by Technical Support personnel to diagnose 
	the problem.

 Explanation:
	The server has detected an internal logic error. A buffer cache lock
	could not be properly converted from IX mode to IS mode. This message
	indicates which page was being locked, and which lock-list and lock ID
	were in use.

 System Status:
	The server is brought down immediately. Since this message indicates
	an internal logic error, processing cannot continue within the server.
	The RCP will perform recovery on any databases which were open by the
	server.

 Recommendation:
	Notify Ingres Corporation Technical Support. Please save the error 
	log, the RCP log file, and all other diagnostic information, as

	%4d - maximum legal record length

 Explanation:
	Journal records are blocked by the system into journal pages. Each
	journal record begins with a length, followed by the journal record
	proper. If the length is invalid, the journal record cannot be read.
	This message gives detailed information about the journal record
	which could not be read. It will be followed in the error log by
	message E_DM9031_BAD_JNL_LENGTH and E_DM9C00_JNL_FILE_INFO.

	%1d - number of children on page
	%2d - page number

 Explanation:
	This warning is generated if the btree index page delete routine
	is called with a BID which does not indicate an existing key on
	the index page.  The request is treated as successful even though
	no delete is performed since the entry has seemingly already been
	deleted.  This is a somewhat unexpected condition, so this warning
	is left in place to track its occurrence.

 System Status:
	The query will continue normally.

 Recommendation:
	Save error logs and trace logs for Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM9C1D_BXBADKEY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - entry on page which is bad
	%1d - page number of bad index page
	%2d - number of key entries on the page
	%3d - key length
	%4d - offset on page of key

 Explanation:
	During a btree access operation, an inconsistency was found
	on a key entry of the indicated page.  This likely indicates
	that the btree index is corrupt.

 System Status:
	The transaction or statement which encountered this error is aborted.
	The table may be structurally corrupt. Operations on other rows in
	this table may be successful (if the corrupted page is not accessed).

 Recommendation:
	Please save the error log, and contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support
	for assistance in debugging and resolving this problem.


E_DM9C1E_BXKEY_ALLOC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - entry on page which is bad
	%1d - page number of bad index page
	%2d - number of key entries on the page
	%3d - key length

 Explanation:
	An error occurred during an attempt to insert a new key into a btree
	index page.  The BID to which the insert was attempted either did not
	make sense or could not be inserted into.

	This could indicate an error during the btree space allocation function
	or it could be that the insert function was called with a bad (or
	uninitialized) BID.

 System Status:
	The transaction or statement which encountered this error is aborted.
	The table may be structurally corrupt. Operations on other rows in
	this table may be successful (if the corrupted page is not accessed).

 Recommendation:
	Please save the error log, and contact Ingres Corporation Technical 
	Support for assistance in debugging and resolving this problem.


E_DM9C1F_BXOVFL_ALLOC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This is a traceback message which is reported when an error occurs
	allocating an overflow leaf page in a btree index.  Overflow pages
	may be allocated when duplicate keys are inserted into a btree.

	Previous error messages should have been logged giving further details
	of the error.

 System Status:
	The transaction or statement which encountered this error is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Please save the error log, and contact Ingres Corporation Technical 
	Support for assistance in debugging and resolving this problem.


E_DM9C20_CRITICAL_SECTION:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Due to the protocols of the transaction recovery system, an update must
	be completed once it is logged.  If an error occurs after having
	logged an update but before having made it, rollback recovery will
	fail.  Therefore, if such an error occurs, redo processing must be
	run to re-apply the logged update before it can be rolled back.
	This currently requires that the server be brought down.  This
	error will result in a dmd_check().

	The DBMS should check all possible error conditions before logging
	an update to ensure that the update can proceed without incident
	so that this dmd_check() does not occur.  When this error does occur,
	extra checks should be added, if possible, to the update routine to
	catch the error before the update log record is written.

 System Status:
	The server is crashed via a dmd_check(); redo recovery should recover
	the user database.

 Recommendation:
	Please save the error log, and contact Ingres Corporation Technical 
	Support for assistance in debugging and resolving this problem.


E_DM9C21_BXOVFL_ALLOC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error occurred while adding a new key to a btree index, and that
	key was a duplicate of other keys in the btree.  The current leaf
	page which holds that key value was full and required a new page to
	be allocated.  This new page should be added as a btree overflow page
	and linked via the overflow page pointers to the leaf page.

	An error occurred during this adding of a new overflow page.  This
	message serves as a traceback message and should be accompanied by
	previous messages giving more details on the problem.

 System Status:
	The current query will fail and its transaction aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Run diagnostics on the btree index (via verifydb) and try SELECTs
	from the btree to check for index inconsistencies.  Please save the
	error log, and contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support for 
	assistance in debugging and resolving this problem.


E_DM9C22_BXOVFL_INCONSIST:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error occurred while deleting a key from a btree overflow
	chain, causing the overflow page on which the key resided to become
	empty.  This empty page should be reclaimed and removed from the
	overflow chain.

	The empty page could not be reclaimed, because the page could not
	be found which points to the empty page.  This may indicate that the
	overflow chain is corrupt and that the overflow page does not correctly
	point back to the true start of the overflow chain.

 System Status:
	The current query will fail and its transaction aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Run diagnostics on the btree index (via verifydb) and try SELECTs
	from the btree to check for index inconsistencies.  Please save the
	error log, and contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support for 
	assistance in debugging and resolving this problem.


E_DM9C23_BXOVFL_FREE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error occurred while deleting a key from a btree overflow
	chain, causing the overflow page on which the key resided to become
	empty.  This empty page should be reclaimed and removed from the
	overflow chain.

	This message serves as a traceback message and should be accompanied by
	previous messages giving more details on the problem.

 System Status:
	The current query will fail and its transaction aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Run diagnostics on the btree index (via verifydb) and try SELECTs
	from the btree to check for index inconsistencies.  Please save the
	error log, and contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support for 
	assistance in debugging and resolving this problem.


E_DM9C24_BXGETDUP_KEY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error occurred during an insert to a btree leaf which contains 
	an overflow chain.  Since all keys on an overflow chain must be
	duplicates, the DBMS must compare the new key with the keys already
	on the overflow chain (if there are any).

	This error occurred while looking for an existing key with which 
	to make the comparison.

	This message serves as a traceback message and should be accompanied by
	previous messages giving more details on the problem.

 System Status:
	The current query will fail and its transaction aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Run diagnostics on the btree index (via verifydb) and try SELECTs
	from the btree to check for index inconsistencies.  Please save the
	error log, and contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support for 
	assistance in debugging and resolving this problem.


E_DM9C25_DM1B_RCB_UPDATE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error occurred during an update to the index portion of a
	btree table.  When keys are moved, inserted, or deleted in a btree
	index, other entries on the same index page may get shifted up
	or down (or even to other pages during splits).

	When this happens, other transaction cursors which point to affected
	keys must be adjusted to follow the moved rows.

	This error occurred in the routine which adjusts other cursor positions.

	This message serves as a traceback message and should be accompanied by
	previous messages giving more details on the problem.

 System Status:
	The current query will fail and its transaction aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Please save the error log, and contact Ingres Corporation Technical 
	Support for assistance in debugging and resolving this problem.


E_DM9C26_SVPT_RCB_RESTORE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	none

 Explanation:
	This warning message is given when information for a table that
	is being left open during an abort to savepoint cannot be found
	in the savepoint control block's open table list.

	The savepoint cb contains a list of all rcb's that were open when
	a savepoint was declared.

	When an abort is done to a savepoint, all tables opened since that
	savepoint was declared are closed.  Only those tables which were
	open at the time the savepoint was declared are left open - thus
	all of these tables should be described in the savepoint cb's
	open table list (srcb queue).

 System Status:
	The abort to savepoint will succeed.  It is possible that attempts
	to use some user cursor that should have been left open will fail
	because of the inability to restore the cursor state.

 Recommendation:
	Please save the error log, and contact Ingres Corporation Technical 
	Support for assistance in debugging and resolving this problem.


E_DM9C27_SVPT_RCB_INFO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c	table name
	%1c	savepoint name
	%2d	table id
	%3d
	%4d	last savepoint id recorded in rcb
	%5d	savepoint id

 Explanation:
	This warning message is given when information for a table that
	is being left open during an abort to savepoint cannot be found
	in the savepoint control block's open table list.

	The savepoint cb contains a list of all rcb's that were open when
	a savepoint was declared.

	When an abort is done to a savepoint, all tables opened since that
	savepoint was declared are closed.  Only those tables which were
	open at the time the savepoint was declared are left open - thus
	all of these tables should be described in the savepoint cb's
	open table list (srcb queue).

 System Status:
	The abort to savepoint will succeed.  It is possible that attempts
	to use some user cursor that should have been left open will fail
	because of the inability to restore the cursor state.

 Recommendation:
	Please save the error log, and contact Ingres Corporation Technical 
	Support for assistance in debugging and resolving this problem.

W_DM9C50_DM2T_FIX_NOTFOUND:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Warning error code indicates that the TCB for the requested
	table does not exist in the DMF table cache.  This is a warning
	error code only and should never be written to the error log.

 System Status:
	Internal use only; does not effect query processing.

 Recommendation:
	None.


W_DM9C51_DM2T_FIX_BUSY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Warning error code indicates that the TCB for the requested
	table was found in the DMF table cache but is currently busy.
	This is a warning error code only and should never be written 
	to the error log.

 System Status:
	Internal use only; does not effect query processing.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_DM9C52_VALID_COUNT_MISMATCH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2d - valid count

 Explanation:
	A Table Control Block (TCB) was found to have a non-zero valid
	count when it expected the count to be zero.

	Since the reference count of the TCB is zero, the valid count
	(which is the count of references to the TCB which validated
	the TCB) should also be zero.  A non-zero valid count probably
	indicates that a session released its reference to the TCB without
	decrementing the valid count.

 System Status:
	The TCB's valid count is set to zero and the query continues.

 Recommendation:
	None required, but the error message should be reported to 
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

	None.

 Explanation:
	This is an internal DMF message indicating a problem opening
	a table I/O control block.  A more detailed description of the 
	cause of the error will be found in the error log.

 System Status:
	The statement that encountered this error will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the contents of the error log to 
	determine the cause of the error.


E_DM9C5C_DM2T_ADD_TBIO_LOCERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A location was unable to be added to an existing table I/O control
	block due to the supplied location information not being consistent
	with the current table I/O control block.  The new location specified
	a location number or ID outside the possible ranges.

 System Status:
	The attempted operation will fail.  Unfortunately, this operation
	is usually executed during recovery processing, so the database
	may be left inconsistent due to a recovery error.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the contents of the error log to 
	determine the cause of the error.  The database may need to be
	restored from a checkpoint if marked inconsistent.


E_DM9C5D_DM2T_PURGEFIXED_WARN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c     - database name
	%1c,%2c - table name, owner
	%3d     - reference count of TCB
	%4d     - reference count including background threads
	%5x     - TCB status vector

 Explanation:
	A purge request was made on the specified table -- most likely during
	some sort of table-modifying operation.  The protocols of these
	operations require that the current TCB be flushed from the table
	cache.  Doing so requires exclusive access to the TCB.

	If the TCB is fixed by another thread at the time of the PURGE request,
	the purge operation will wait for the TCB to become unreferenced so
	that it can be tossed.  The caller is expected to have the table
	locked to guarantee that the wait will be successful.

	If the purge operation finds that the TCB is fixed by other than a
	cache background thread (write behind, fast commit), then it can
	no longer guarantee that its wait will be successful.  It logs
	this error message and attempts the wait anyway, in the hope that
	the unexpected fixer will go away.

 System Status:
	The current operation may continue normally or may hang forever,
	requiring the server to be brought down to free up the hung thread.

 Recommendation:
	The user should look for recent errors in the error log to determine
	if the unexpected condition may have been the result of a previous
	error while accessing this table.  Any error and trace log information
	should be saved for Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM9C5E_DM2T_ADD_RETRY_CNT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A location was unable to be added to an existing table I/O control
	block due to the inability to find a TCB to which to add the new 
	location or the inability to gain exclusive access to that TCB.

 System Status:
	The attempted operation will fail.  Unfortunately, this operation
	is usually executed during recovery processing, so the database
	may be left inconsistent due to a recovery error.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the contents of the error log to 
	determine the cause of the error.  The database may need to be
	restored from a checkpoint if marked inconsistent.


E_DM9C5F_DM2T_PURGEBUSY_WARN:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c     - database name
	%1c,%2c - table name, owner
	%3d     - reference count of TCB
	%4d     - reference count including background threads
	%5x     - TCB status vector

 Explanation:
	A purge request was made on the specified table -- most likely during
	some sort of table-modifying operation.  The protocols of these
	operations require that the current TCB be flushed from the table
	cache.  Doing so requires exclusive access to the TCB.

	If the TCB is fixed by another thread at the time of the PURGE request,
	the purge operation will wait for the TCB to become unreferenced so
	that it can be tossed.  The caller is expected to have the table
	locked to guarantee that the wait will be successful.

	If the purge operation finds that the TCB is already listed as
	undergoing a purge request -- and that another thread is seemingly
	waiting for exclusive access to the TCB -- then something is messed
	up.  Rather than having two threads waiting for each other to
	release the TCB, this session will return an error.

 System Status:
	The current operation will fail.

 Recommendation:
	The user should look for recent errors in the error log to determine
	if the unexpected condition may have been the result of a previous
	error while accessing this table.  Any error and trace log information
	should be saved for Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM9C60_DM1R_DELETE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred while DMF was attempting to delete a record from the
	database. A more detailed description of the cause of the error will
	be found in the error log.

 System Status:
	The statement that encountered this error will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the contents of the error log to 
	determine the cause of the error.


E_DM9C70_DM2T_RELEASE_IDXERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c     - database name
	%1c,%2c - table name, owner

 Explanation:
	A release TCB request was made by a DBMS routine which incorrectly
	passed a secondary index TCB rather than its parent base table TCB.

 System Status:
	The current operation will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Please report this error to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM9C71_DM2T_ADD_TBIO_INFO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - location number (offset in table's location array)
	%4d - location ID (offset in config file extent array)
	%5d - table's location count 
	%6c - location name

 Explanation:
	An error prevents the addition of a new location to an existing TCB.
	This could represent a disk error or other inability to open files
	on the specified location.

 System Status:
	The attempted operation will fail.  Unfortunately, this operation
	is usually executed during recovery processing, so the database
	may be left inconsistent due to a recovery error.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the contents of the error log to 
	determine the cause of the error.  The database may need to be
	restored from a checkpoint if marked inconsistent.


E_DM9C72_DM2T_LOCCOUNT_MISMATCH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c     - database name
	%1c     - table name
	%2c     - table owner
	%3d     - iidevices row number
	%4d	- location number (offset in table's location array)
	%5d	- table's location count 

 Explanation:
	A mismatch was found between the iidevices and iirelation records
	for a table when trying to open that table for the server.

	The iidevices entry specified a location ID which was outside the
	range of the iirelation.relloccount value.

 System Status:
	The table cannot be opened by the server until the bad catalog
	information is corrected.

 Recommendation:
	The user should take steps to fix the corrupted database, restoring
	from a valid checkpoint if necessary.


E_DM9C73_DM2T_LOCCOUNT_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - iidevices rows 
	%4d - table's location count 

 Explanation:
	A mismatch was found between the iidevices and iirelation records
	for a table when trying to open that table for the server.

	Not enough iidevices rows were found to match the relloccount value.

 System Status:
	The table cannot be opened by the server until the bad catalog
	information is corrected.

 Recommendation:
	The user should take steps to fix the corrupted database, restoring
	from a valid checkpoint if necessary.


E_DM9C74_DM2T_LOCNAME_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3c - location name

 Explanation:
	A mismatch was found between the iidevices and iirelation records
	for a table when trying to open that table for the server.

	The iidevices entry specified a location name which could not be
	found in the database's extent array.  This array is built from
	config-file information when the database was opened.

 System Status:
	The table cannot be opened by the server until the bad catalog
	information is corrected.

 Recommendation:
	The user should take steps to fix the corrupted database, restoring
	from a valid checkpoint if necessary.


E_DM9C75_DM2D_CLOSE_TCBBUSY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c     - database name
	%1c,%2c - table name, owner
	%3d     - reference count of TCB
	%4d     - reference count excluding background threads
	%5x     - TCB status

 Explanation:
	When a database is closed, all of its TCBs are tossed from the TCB
	cache.  Since there are no open sessions on the database, there
	can be no more referenced tables in it either.

	This error is generated if a TCB for the database being closed is
	found referenced by a session other than a cache background job.

 System Status:
	The close database operation will fail.

 Recommendation:
	The user should look for recent errors in the error log to determine
	if the unexpected condition may have been the result of a previous
	error while accessing this table.  Any error and trace log information
	should be saved for Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM9C76_DM2D_CLOSE_TCBERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c     - database name
	%1c,%2c - table name, owner
	%3d     - reference count of TCB
	%4d     - reference count excluding background threads
	%5x     - TCB status

 Explanation:
	When a database is closed, all of its TCBs are tossed from the TCB
	cache.  Since there are no open sessions on the database, there
	can be no more referenced tables in it either.

	This error is generated if an error is returned from the request to
	release a TCB during the database close.

 System Status:
	The close database operation will fail.

 Recommendation:
	The user should look for recent errors in the error log to determine
	if the unexpected condition may have been the result of a previous
	error while accessing this table.  Any error and trace log information
	should be saved for Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM9C80_ERROR_FINDING_TABIO_PTR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred in the buffer manager while attempting to toss
	a page from the cache.  An unexpected error status was returned
	from the attempt to lookup a table I/O control block with which to
	toss a page.

 System Status:
	Processing will continue after logging the error message.  A new
	page will be selected to force.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the contents of the error log to 
	determine the cause of the error.


E_DM9C81_DM0P_GET_TABIO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred in the buffer manager while attempting to fix a
	table I/O descriptor.

 System Status:
	The buffer manager operation cannot be performed.  Usually this
	means that a page cannot be tossed out of the cache.  The error
	may cause the death of one of the buffer manager background
	threads.  It may also indicate a real problem with access to
	the specified table, and it is possible that future attempts to
	access this table will fail.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the contents of the error log to 
	determine the cause of the error.


E_DM9C82_DM0P_UNFIX_TABIO_INFO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - unique ID associated with buffer manager routine that
	      requested the unfix operation
	%1x - TCB pointer value

 Explanation:
	An error occurred in the buffer manager when attempting to unfix
	a table I/O control block.  This will cause a dmd_check().

 System Status:
	The server will fail with a dmd_check() soon after.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log and trace logs for further information on the
	cause of the error.  Save error and server trace logs for 
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DM9C83_DM0P_CACHEFIX_PAGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred in the buffer manager during a fix-page operation.
	It may have been an attempt to bring a new page into the cache or
	to return a pointer to an existing page.

	A more detailed description of the cause of the error will found in 
	the error log.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the contents of the error log to 
	determine the cause of the error.


E_DM9C84_DM0P_FIX_TABIO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d     - database ID
	%1d,%2d - table ID
	%3d	- page number

 Explanation:
	An error occurred in the buffer manager while attempting to toss
	a page from the cache.  An unexpected error status was returned
	from the attempt to look up a table I/O control block with which
	to toss a page.

 System Status:
	Processing will continue after logging the error message.  A new
	page will be selected to force.  The error could indicate a real
	problem with access to the specified table, however. It is possible
	that future attempts to access this table will fail.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the contents of the error log to 
	determine the cause of the error.


E_DM9C85_DM0P_BICHECK_INFO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table owner
	%3d - page number

 Explanation:
	An error occurred in the buffer manager when attempting to write
	a Before Image log record.  Before Images are written for pages
	fixed for write access while an online backup is in progress
	on the database.

 System Status:
	The inability to write the Before Image will cause the current
	query to fail.  Depending on the reason for the log-write failure,
	subsequent attempts to re-execute the query may succeed.  If the
	problem persists, stopping the online backup and rescheduling
	it for a period of lower database activity may resolve the problem.

	If the error occurs while no online backup is in progress, then
	this indicates a problem with buffer manager state information.

 Recommendation:
	Check the installation error log for further information on the
	cause of the error.  Retry the operation when the online backup
	is no longer in progress.


E_DM9C86_DM0P_BICHECK:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred in the buffer manager when attempting to write
	a Before Image log record.  Before Images are written for pages
	fixed for write access while and online backup is in progress
	on the database.

 System Status:
	The inability to write the Before Image will cause the current
	query to fail.  Depending on the reason for the log write failure,
	subsequent attempts to re-execute the query may succeed.  If the
	problem persists, stopping the online backup and rescheduling
	it for a period of lower database activity may resolve the problem.

	If the error occurs while no online backup is in progress, then
	this indicates a problem with buffer manager state information.

 Recommendation:
	Check the installation error log for further information on the
	cause of the error.  Retry the operation when the online backup
	is no longer in progress.


E_DM9C87_DM0P_UNCACHE_FIX:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:

E_DMA00D_TOO_MANY_LOG_LOCKS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0x - lock-list status flags
	%1x - request flags
	%2d - number of logical locks currently held
	%3d - maximum number of logical locks allowed

 Explanation:
	Logical locks are the locks used by the DBMS for concurrency control and
	transaction serialization (as opposed to physical locks, which are used
	internally for purposes such as cache coherency and table version
	control). Each transaction is limited in the number of logical locks
	it can acquire, to prevent a single transaction from monopolizing the
	resources of the entire system. This lock request is being denied
	because the transaction has reached its resource limit.

 System Status:
	The DBMS will attempt to escalate to table-level locking on this table,
	which reduces lock resource usage. Other processing continues normally.

 Recommendation:
	A transaction which routinely exhausts its logical lock limit should
	be reviewed to see if it can be written more efficiently.  If the 
	per-transaction lock limit is indeed too small, increase it by 
	increasing the value of the ii.*.rcp.lock.per_tx_limit config.dat 
	configuration parameter.


E_DMA00E_LK_NO_RSBS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The locking system could not allocate any more resource blocks. A
	resource block is a data structure used to track a resource which is
	being controlled by the locking system. Example resources include
	tables, pages, databases, and other objects.

	The resource block limit is governed by: the overall availability of
	locking system shared memory; the maximum number of lock/resource blocks
	specified as a configuration parameter (ii.*.rcp.lock.resource_limit) 
	and the recovery demands made by the transactions which are currently 
	running.

 System Status:
	The DBMS will attempt to escalate to table-level locking for (some of) 
	the tables being accessed by this transaction, which reduces lock 
	resource usage.

 Recommendation:
	If resource block exhaustion occurs frequently, the locking system
	should be reconfigured with additional shared memory resources and/or
	higher lock/resource block (ii.*.rcp.lock.resource_limit) limits.


E_DMA00F_LK_NO_LKBS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The locking system could not allocate any more lock request blocks. A
	lock request block is a data structure used to track a particular
	request for a resource which is being controlled by the locking system.
	Example resources include tables, pages, databases, and other objects.

	The lock request block limit is governed by: the overall availability of
	locking system shared memory; the maximum number of lock/resource blocks
	(ii.*.rcp.lock.lock_limit/ii.*.rcp.lock.resource_limit); and the 
	recovery demands made by the transactions which are currently running.

 System Status:
	The DBMS will attempt to escalate to table-level locking for (some of) 
	the tables being accessed by this transaction, which reduces lock 
	resource usage.

 Recommendation:
	If lock request block exhaustion occurs frequently, the locking system
	should be reconfigured with additional shared memory resources and/or
	higher lock/resource block ((ii.*.rcp.lock.lock_limit/
	ii.*.rcp.lock.resource_limit)) limits.


E_DMA010_LK_NO_LKBS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The locking system could not allocate any more lock request blocks. A
	lock request block is a data structure used to track a particular
	request for a resource which is being controlled by the locking system.
	Example resources include tables, pages, databases, and other objects.

	The lock request block limit is governed by: the overall availability of
	locking system shared memory; the maximum number of lock/resource blocks
	(ii.*.rcp.lock.lock_limit/ii.*.rcp.lock.resource_limit); and the 
	recovery demands made by the transactions which are currently running.

 System Status:
	The DBMS will attempt to escalate to table-level locking for (some of) 
	the tables being accessed by this transaction, which reduces lock 
	resource usage.

 Recommendation:
	If lock request block exhaustion occurs frequently, the locking system
	should be reconfigured with additional shared memory resources and/or
	higher lock/resource block limits (ii.*.rcp.lock.resource_limit).


E_DMA011_LK_NO_LLBS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The locking system could not allocate any more lock-list blocks. A
	lock-list block is a data structure used to track a collection of lock
	requests for resources which are being controlled by the locking system.
	Example resources include tables, pages, databases, and other objects.

	The lock-list block limit is governed by: the overall availability of
	locking system shared memory; the maximum number of lock list blocks
	specified as a configuration parameter (ii.*.rcp.lock.list_limit); and 
	the recovery demands made by the transactions which are currently 
	running.

 System Status:
	The DBMS will attempt to escalate to table-level locking for (some of) 
	the tables being accessed by this transaction, which reduces lock 
	resource usage.

 Recommendation:
	If lock-list block exhaustion occurs frequently, the locking system
	should be reconfigured with additional shared memory resources and/or
	higher lock-list block limits (ii.$.rcp.lock.list_limit).


E_DMA012_LK_NO_LLBS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The locking system could not allocate any more lock-list blocks. A
	lock-list block is a data structure used to track a collection of lock
	requests for resources which are being controlled by the locking system.
	Example resources include tables, pages, databases, and other objects.

	The lock list block limit is governed by: the overall availability of
	locking system shared memory; the maximum number of lock list blocks
	specified as a configuration parameter (ii.$.rcp.lock.list_limit); 
	and the recovery demands made by the transactions which are currently 
	running.

 System Status:
	The DBMS will attempt to escalate to table-level locking for (some of) 
	the tables being accessed by this transaction, which reduces lock 
	resource usage.

 Recommendation:
	If lock-list block exhaustion occurs frequently, the locking system
	should be reconfigured with additional shared memory resources and/or
	higher lock-list block (ii.$.rcp.lock.list_limit) limits.


E_DMA013_LK_BAD_INIT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

	If the error cannot be resolved, contact Ingres Corporation Technical 
	Support for assistance.


E_DMA015_LKEVENT_SYNC_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message indicates that LKevent() encountered an error requesting or
	releasing a semaphore.

 System Status:
	The LKevent() call is rejected. Depending on the reason for the
	semaphore error, the locking system may be unusable, which may render
	the DBMS unusable.

 Recommendation:
	Consult the error log for additional information about the error
	on the semaphore. If the problem cannot be resolved, contact
	Technical Support for assistance.


E_DMA016_LKEVENT_LIST_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - lock-list identifier

 Explanation:
	This is an internal debugging message which indicates that a lock-list
	has erroneously attempted to wait for an event twice.

 System Status:
	The LKevent() call is rejected. The lock-list may be unusable. The
	system may need to be shut down and restarted to clear this
	condition.

 Recommendation:
	Please report this error to Ingres Corporation Technical Support 
	for diagnosis.


E_DMA017_LK_MUTEX_RELEASED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message should never appear in the error log. It is an
	informational error code which is used internally to communicate
	semaphore status from one routine to another. If this message ever
	appears in the error log, it indicates that a bug has occurred within
	the locking system software.

 System Status:
	If a bug occurs within the locking system software, the DBMS will 
	probably not work properly. Subsequent errors will probably occur, 
	and the system will probably shut itself down.

 Recommendation:
	If this message ever appears in the error log, please report this to
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support. Please save the contents of the 
	error and trace logs for technical support personnel to use in problem
	determination.


E_DMA018_LK_LLB_TOO_FEW:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - value provided for LLB limit
	%1d - minimum supported value for LLB table size

 Explanation:
	The locking system allows for a configurable number of lock-list blocks,
	but there is a minimum possible value for this number, and the value
	specified is too low. The error message parameters in the error log
	describe the value provided and the system-defined minimum.

 System Status:
	The system will not run as configured.

 Recommendation:
	Reconfigure the locking system parameters and provide a larger value
	for the Lock List Block value (ii.*.rcp.lock.list_limit).  Be sure

	%5d         - highest legal value for the bytes-used value

 Explanation:
	Each transaction log file page is self-identifying, as it stores 
	internal page information redundantly on the page. When the page 
	is read in, the information on the page is checked to see that it 
	is in the expected range of values; if it is not, this error 
	message is issued.

 System Status:
	The page cannot be successfully read.

	If dual logging is enabled, the log file which suffered the error will
	be disabled, and processing will continue using the other log file. If
	dual logging is NOT enabled, this is a hard error and will result in an
	error return to the caller.

 Recommendation:
	This message may indicate that an I/O error occurred on the log file
	device, or it may indicate that there is an internal bug in the 
	log page address routines. Check the log file device for any hardware

 Parameters:
	%0d,%1d,%2d - log record address of the in-memory end of file

 Explanation:
	This message is not necessarily an error. It simply indicates that a
	log file scan has reached the end of the log file (if scanning forward)
	or the beginning of the log file (if scanning backward). This is usually
	not an error, but is logged anyway in order to track recovery actions
	when scanning the log file.

	This message follows E_DMA460, and records the in-memory end-of-file in
	the case when that value differs from the on-disk end-of-file.

 System Status:
	Normal processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	No action is needed. This message is merely used to record the log file
	boundaries during recovery processing.

	%1x - transaction status value

 Explanation:
	This error occurs when a DMF routine attempts to grab ownership
	of a transaction through the LGalter(LG_A_OWNER) call which is
	not an orphaned willing commit transaction.

	The LG_A_OWNER call is used to adopt willing commit transactions
	that were disconnected when their front-end connection died, or
	following recovery of a system failure.  It should not be called
	on an active or owned transaction.

	This error indicates an internal protocol error.

 System Status:
	The database reconnect will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Collect data from logstat and the RCP log for Ingres Corporation 
	Technical Support so they can diagnose and repair the problem.


E_DMA48E_LOGFULL_EXCEEDED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d,%1d,%2d - log file BOF
	%3d,%4d,%5d - log file EOF
	%6d         - LG reserved space

 Explanation:
	While the installation is active, the logging system preserves log 
	file space that it believes is necessary to recover all outstanding
	transactions.

	If the log file used and reserved space continues to grow past the
	LOGFULL limit, it may be an indication that log file space is being
	used up more quickly than the space reservation algorithms expected.

	If the log file used and reserved space grows past the LOGFULL limit
	to the point where it reaches 98% of the log file size, the system
	will panic.  By shutting down, recovery can run in an offline mode
	where space usage is more controlled.  Hopefully, this recovery mode
	will succeed.

 System Status:
	The installation is shut down.

 Recommendation:
	The error should be reported and a logdump of the current log file
	saved to assist determining why the space reservation algorithms
	did not accurately predict the required log file space.

	In the meantime, the user should reduce the logfull and force_abort 
	system limits (by 5% each) to give the logging system additional 
	log file space for recovery during LOGFULL situations and keep the
	error from recurring.


E_DMA48F_LOGFILE_FULL:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d,%1d,%2d - log file BOF
	%3d,%4d,%5d - log file EOF
	%6d         - LG reserved space

 Explanation:
	While the installation is active, the logging system preserves
	log file space that it believes is necessary to recover all outstanding
	transactions.

	If the log file used and reserved space continues to grow past the
	LOGFULL limit, it may be an indication that log file space is being
	used up more quickly than the space reservation algorithms expected.

	If the log file used and reserved space grows past the LOGFULL limit
	to the point where it reaches 100% of the log file size, the system
	will panic and can no longer write log records.

 System Status:
	The installation is shut down.

 Recommendation:
	The error should be reported and a logdump of the current log file
	saved to assist determining why the space reservation algorithms
	did not accurately predict the required log file space.

	To resolve this situation, the log file will need to be reinitialized
	and databases restored from checkpoints.

	While the installation is active, the logging system preserves
	log file space that it believes is necessary to recover all 
	outstanding transactions.

	The current transaction has written more bytes to the log file than
	it had previously reserved.  This indicates an error in the log file
	space reservation protocols.

 System Status:
	As long as the system does not reach an unresolvable LOGFULL situation,
	the system status should not change.

 Recommendation:
	The error should be reported and a logdump of the current log file
	saved to assist determining why the space reservation algorithms
	did not accurately predict the required log file space.


E_DMA491_LFB_RESERVED_SPACE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - Total log reserved space

 Explanation:
	While the installation is active, the logging system preserves
	log file space that it believes is necessary to recover all outstanding
	transactions.

	The current transactions have written more bytes to the log file than
	had been previously reserved.  This indicates an error in the log file
	space reservation protocols.

 System Status:
	As long as the system does not reach an unresolvable LOGFULL situation,
	the system status should not change.

 Recommendation:
	The error should be reported and a logdump of the current log file
	saved to assist determining why the space reservation algorithms
	did not accurately predict the required log file space.


E_DMA492_LGOPEN_BLKSIZE_MISMATCH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None

 Explanation:
	When an installation is started, the recovery server verifies that 
	logging system configuration parameters match those currently
	in use.  This error is generated when the log file block size 
	stored in config.dat differs from that currently used. 

	It is likely that an inadvertent change has been made to config.dat 
	to change the log file block size (ii.*.rcp.log.block_size)
	without reinitializing the log file.

 System Status:
	Either restore the correct version of config.dat, or re-initialize
	the log file to configure a new block size.

 Explanation:
      A problem has been encountered in the translation of a command-line
      specified delimited object name (e.g., table, file, or owner name)
      into a "normalized" (internal) format.  The most common causes of
      this problem are:

       - Identifier not formatted properly for this operating system.
         (Unix systems require that a single quote exist at the start
         and end of the identifier.  VMS requires that objects be enclosed
         in double quotes.)  Escape characters are also required to
         include certain objects in the string.

       - Invalid character embedded in the object. Allowed characters are:
              space           double quote    percent         ampersand
              quote           left paren      r paren         asterisk
              plus            comma           minus           period
              slash           colon           semicolon       less than
              equals          greater than    question mark   underscore
              vertical bar

 System Status:
      The utility startup will fail.

 Recommendation:
      Rerun the utility, specifying the correct argument syntax.


E_DMB126_MMX_DB_NOT_DB_OWNER:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DMB127_MMX_CLOSE_IIUSER:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DMB128_MMX_VERSION_MISMATCH:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0x - version number with which the memory was created
      %1x - version number of this process's software.

 Explanation:
      The MANMAN/X shared memory pool is used by the DBMS for purposes
      such as transaction logging and concurrency control. All processes that
      share this memory must be at exactly the same version level or
      the shared memory data structures will be corrupted. This process
      is not at the same version level as the process which created the
      memory, and therefore this process is refusing to access the shared
      memory.

 System Status:
      This process will not start. Other processes may be able to continue,
      provided they are at the correct version level.

 Recommendation:
      Upgrade this program to the current level of the DBMS software.

      None.

 Explanation:
      The MANMAN/X shared memory pool is used by the DBMS for purposes
      such as handling MANMAN/X Requests and BTREE's. All processes that
      share this memory must be at exactly the same version level or
      the shared memory data structures will be corrupted. This process
      is not at the same version level as the process which created the
      memory, and therefore this process is refusing to access the shared
      memory.

 System Status:
      This process will not start. Other processes may be able to continue,
      provided they are at the correct version level.

 Recommendation:
      Upgrade this program to the current level of the DBMS software.

E_DMF00D_NOT_DCB:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
 *	None.

 Explanation:
	This message indicates a fatal internal error. An attempt to access a
	database was aborted because the Database Control Block in
	memory was found to have an incorrect control block type. This may
	indicate memory corruption, or it may indicate a software bug in 
	the DBMS.

 System Status:
	The process which encountered this error terminates. If a trace log
	is available, a memory dump of the process will be printed.

 Recommendation:
	Please save the trace log if a trace log was in use. Please report this
	problem to Ingres Corporation Technical Support immediately; they 
	will give you instructions on how to proceed.

	(Technical Support: this message comes from dmd_check(), which signals a
	fatal error condition to the process in question. dmd_check() will
	attempt to print a memory dump of the DMF control blocks -- save this
	log for analysis. If the problem was due to memory corruption, it may
	be hard to reproduce, so try to capture as much information (what was
	the user doing, were there any other messages in the error log, etc.)
	as possible now. Then have the customer retry the operation to see if
	it will now succeed).


E_DMF00E_NOT_FCB:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:

E_DMF024_INCOMPLETE_CP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_DMF025_BM_CONNECT_COUNT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The buffer manager keeps an internal count of the number of servers
	which are connected to it.  When servers start up or shut down, they
	are expected to increment/decrement this count accordingly.

	Each server connected to a buffer manager holds a shared buffer manager
	lock on its server lock-list.  At strategic times (server startup and
	at consistency points), servers will check the number of holders
	of the buffer manager lock and compare it with the connect count.
	If the counts do not match, some server has exited without adjusting
	the connect count.

	This is currently considered a fatal error, as the buffer manager is
	left in an unpredictable state -- lists may be trashed and data may
	be corrupt.

	When this message is displayed, it means that DMF is shutting down the
	server.

 System Status:
	Server is shut down.  All other servers connected to this same buffer
	manager will also be shut down automatically.

 Recommendation:
	Restart servers -- examine log to see reason why original server exited
	abnormally.  This could have happened due to a server fatal error or
	because the user stopped the DBMS server process rather than shutting
	it down normally.


E_DMF026_DMPP_PAGE_INCONS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This is an indication of a serious inconsistency detected by
	the routines that access DBMS system catalog (SCONCUR) pages.  
	As a result of this problem, the server will fail.  This error 
	is generally a result of a server bug.  

	In most circumstances, additional diagnostic information will
	have been written to II_DBMS_LOG prior to the shutdown.

 System Status:
	The server is shut down (dmd_check() is called).

 Recommendation:
	Restart the server to determine if the problem is reproducible.
	In any case, save the error log and II_DBMS_LOG information
	and contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DMF028_DM0P_UNFIX_TABIO:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred in the buffer manager when attempting to unfix
	a table I/O control block.

 System Status:
	The server will fail due to inability to guarantee cache consistency.
	The server will shut down to let redo recovery rebuild the database
	contents.
	
	In most circumstances, additional diagnostic information will
	have been written to II_DBMS_LOG prior to the shutdown.

 Recommendation:
	Restart the server to determine if the problem is reproducible.
	In any case, save the error log and II_DBMS_LOG information
	and contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DMF029_DMXE_PASS_ABORT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred in transaction abort processing when attempting to
	pass the transaction to the dmfrcp process for pass-abort processing.

 System Status:
	The server will fail due to the inability to communicate the transaction
	status to the dmfrcp process. The server shutdown will let redo
	recovery rebuild the database contents.

	In most circumstances, additional diagnostic information will
	have been written to II_DBMS_LOG prior to the shutdown.

 Recommendation:
	Restart the server to determine if the problem is reproducible.
	In any case, save the error log and II_DBMS_LOG information
	and contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

 Explanation:
	Code has attempted to set the ParentApplication attribute of a
	component which is currently executing.  This is not allowed.

 System Status:
	The ParentApplication attribute will not be changed.  If it was
	being changed to NULL, this will result in the component not being
	removed from the cache.

 Recommendation:
	None required in most cases.  If it is important to change the
	ParentApplication attribute; wait until the component is no longer
	executing to do so.


E_DO0073_CANNOT_OPEN_TEMPFILE


 Explanation:
	The system tried to open a file in the temporary file area for
	intermediate storage, and couldn't.

 System Status:
	Execution cannot continue because the intermediate storage file
	is required for whatever action is taking place.

	objects that the user owns orphans (since the user name has been
	corrupted, the objects will be orphans anyway).

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If prompted, the user must enter Yes/No permission to drop this table.

	It might be a good idea for the user to answer NO to all subsequent
	verifydb prompts, go in via accessdb and assure that all users are
	defined (and if not, define them), then re-run verifydb.


S_DU032F_CLEAR_BADBITS


 Parameters:
	%0c - user name

 Explanation:
	iiuser.status is a bitmap of user privileges; some of the bits set
	in the bitmap are invalid, so verifydb wants to zero the invalid bits.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If prompted, the user must enter Yes/No permission to drop this table.

	There is a good chance that the user's permissions may not be right
	if there were invalid bits in the permission bitmap.  The system
	administrator should run accessdb to assure that the user has the
	correct permissions.


S_DU0330_DROP_IIDATABASE_TUPLE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #69 found a tuple with an invalid database name specifier.
	The recommended corrective action to make the database database
	catalogs consistent is to drop information about this database from
	the installation by removing it from the iidatabase catalog.

	The user will be prompted to give yes/no permission.  If yes is given,
	verifydb will take recommended action.  If no is given, verifydb will
	proceed on to next text.

	NOTE: This message will also be displayed in REPORT mode, but the user
	will not be given the opportunity to input yes/no permission.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message; processing continues.  However,
	this type of message requires input from the user. The S_DU0300_PROMPT
	message will be displayed following this message, and processing will
	simply wait until some input is given.  If the input is not a valid
	response, the message will be repeated until a valid response is given.

 Recommendation:
	Enter Y(ES) or N(O).


S_DU0331_CREATE_IIEXTEND_ENTRY


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name (from iidatabase.name)
	%1c - database default data location (from iidatabase.dbdev)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #72 found no iiextend entry for this database.  All
	databases should have at least one entry in iiextend for their default
	data location.  Additionally, databases extended via accessdb will have
	an entry for each extended location, but we cannot test for that here.
	verifydb will build a iiextend tuple, since it has all the information
	that it needs.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless verifydb is being run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, then
	the user must give Yes/No answer to the prompt.


S_DU0332_CREATE_DBACCESS_ENTRY


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name (from iidatabase.name)
	%1c - database owner (from iidatabase.own)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #76 found no iidbaccess entry for the DBA of this
	private database.  It is possible that this database should really
	be marked public and iidatabase.access is corrupted.  However, it is
	also possible that this database is really a private database, and
	somehow the DBA no longer has access to it.  This fix will force the
	database to be private and will give access to the DBA.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless verifydb is being run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, then
	the user must give Yes/No answer to the prompt.


S_DU0333_MARK_DB_OPERATIVE


 Parameters:
	None.
 Explanation:

 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - table owner
	%2c - database name

 Explanation:
      verifydb's drop_table action will prompt the user for permission to
      drop the table if running in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. Otherwise, it will
      just go ahead with the drop. If the feature is evoked in REPORT mode,
      verifydb will log that the table should be dropped and exit
      without dropping it.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If prompted, the user must enter Yes/No permission to drop this table.
	Otherwise, no action is required.


S_DU037E_DROP_USER


 Parameters:
	%0c - user name

 Explanation:
	verifydb deleted the tuple from the iiuser table.  This effectively
	dropped the user from the installation (and made any database objects
	that user owns orphans; however, since the user name has been corrupted,
	the objects will be orphans anyway).

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If the user sees this message, they should use accessdb to add anyone
	back who was dropped and should not have been.


S_DU037F_CLEAR_BADBITS

	in the bitmap are invalid; verifydb zeroed the invalid bits.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	There is a good chance that the user's permissions may not be right
	if there were invalid bits in the permission bitmap.  The system
	administrator should run accessdb to assure that the user has the
	correct permissions.


S_DU0380_DROP_IIDATABASE_TUPLE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #69 found a tuple with an invalid database name specifier.

	The user should run finddbs to attempt to recover the database.


S_DU0381_CREATE_IIEXTEND_ENTRY


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name (from iidatabase.name)
	%1c - default data location (from iidatabase.dbdev)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #72 found no iiextend entry for this database.  All
	databases should have at least one entry in iiextend for their default
	data location.  Additionally, databases extended via accessdb will have
	an entry for each extended location, but we cannot test for that here.
	verifydb will build a iiextend tuple, since it has all the information
	it needs.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU0382_CREATE_DBACCESS_ENTRY


 Parameters:
	%0c - database owner (from iidatabase.own)
	%1c - database name (from iidatabase.name)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #76 found no iidbaccess entry for the DBA of this
	private database.  It is possible that this database should really
	be marked public and iidatabase.access is corrupted.  However, it is
	also possible that this database is really a private database, and
	somehow the DBA no longer has access to it.  verifydb has now forced
	the database to be private, and has given access to the DBA.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user may wish to use accessdb to give other users access
	to this database.


S_DU0383_MARK_DB_OPERATIVE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #77 found that the database was not marked operative,
	but there was no reason that the database should not be marked as such.

	secondary index table by placing a valid entry for this database in it.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	If in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the user must give a Yes/No answer to the 
	verifydb prompt.  Otherwise, no action is required.

	database.  verifydb knows it is a private database, because there is a
	valid entry in table iidbaccess, giving the DBA access to the database.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU0389_DROP_LOCATION


 Parameters:
	%0c - location physical name (from iilocations.area)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #88 found an invalid location logical name.
	(See message S_DU166B_INVALID_LOCNAME for a full
	explanation.)

 System Status:
	This is an informational message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	After the corrective action is taken, the user should use accessdb to
	redefine the location. NOTE: The user must use the same logical/physical
	names that the location was previously defined at, since the location
	information is in the config file.  If the user does not know how the

	%1c - expired table owner

 Explanation:
	verifydb's purge operation found an expired relation in the database.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message; processing continues.  However,
	this type of message may require input from the user.  The
	S_DU0300_PROMPT message will be displayed following this message,
	and processing will simply wait until some input is given.  If the
	input is not a valid response, the message will be repeated until a
	valid response is given.

 Recommendation:
	In RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the user must answer the Yes/No prompt.
	If user does not want to destroy this table, they should change the
	expiration date in iirelation.relsave.  If they set it to zero, then
	the relation becomes permanent, or cannot expire.

S_DU0420_DROP_INDEX


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	verifydb's TABLE or XTABLE in PATCH mode (RUN, RUNINTERACTIVE, or
	RUNSILENT) cannot allow secondary indexes to exist on the target
	table. The patch operation may cause the secondary index to get out
	of sync with the base table, which would create an inconsistent
	condition.

	Therefore, verifydb deletes the secondary indexes, and it is the
	user's responsibility to recreate them after they are satisfied with
	the patch operation.

	This message indicates that verifydb has detected the secondary index.
	In RUN or RUNSILENT mode, verifydb will automatically drop it.  In
	RUNINTERACTIVE mode, verifydb will prompt the user for permission to
	drop the table.

 System Status:
	verifydb will continue running.  However, if verifydb is in
	RUNINTERACTIVE mode and the user withholds permission, verifydb
	processing will terminate.

 Recommendation:
	If in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the user must enter YES/NO permission
	in response to the prompt.


S_DU0421_DROP_INDEX


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	verifydb's TABLE or XTABLE in PATCH mode (RUN, RUNINTERACTIVE, or
	RUNSILENT) cannot allow secondary indexes to exist on the target
	table. The patch operation may cause the secondary index to get out
	of sync with the base table, which would create an inconsistent
	condition.

	Therefore, verifydb deletes the secondary indexes, and it is the
	user's responsibility to recreate them after they are satisfied with
	the patch operation.

	This message identifies the function of the utility (createdb or
	destroydb), which gateway is involved, and which database it is
	operating on.

 System Status:
	Informational only; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


I_DU0521_GW_UTIL_GENERAL


 Parameters:
	%0c - text ("Destroy" or "Create")

W_DU1020_DEL_DIRNOTFOUND


W_DU1021_DEL_FILENOTFOUND


W_DU1030_UNKNOWN_CATALOG_SY


W_DU1031_NOMOD_FE_CAT


 Explanation:
	    SYSMOD just tried to call an internal utility program called "modifyfe"
	    to modify the front-end system catalogs. Modifyfe was not able to
	    successfully modify the front-end catalogs.

 System Status:
	    Any other catalogs specified on the SYSMOD command line will be
	    modified. The front-end catalogs were not completely modified
	    (some of them may have been modified before the error occurred).

 Recommendation:
	    Check for problems in your environment and DBMS installation
	    (disk space, subprocess and other quotas, is the installation
	    complete with executables present in the "bin" subdirectory, etc.).
	    VMS users can run the "checkenv" utility.


W_DU1032_FECAT_IGNORE


 Parameters:
	%0c - frontend catalog name

 Explanation:
	You specified the name of a frontend catalog on the sysmod command
	line.  Frontend catalogs are modified in groups by specifying the 
	name of a frontend "dictionary client" on the sysmod command
	line; then all frontend catalogs used by that dictionary client will be
	modified.

 System Status:
	The frontend catalog name is ignored. It is as if it were not
	specified on the sysmod command line.

 Recommendation:
	Check which frontend client you want to modify catalogs for
	and specify that client name on the sysmod command line (for example:
	"sysmod <database_name> vision").

W_DU1046_DUP_DBTUP_FI


W_DU1047_SAME_DB_FI


W_DU1048_ABORT_FI


W_DU1049_LOCNAME_TOO_LONG_FI


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The user entered a location name that is more than 24 characters long in
	response to I_DU0031_NEWLOC_PROMPT_FI.  Location names are limited to
	24 characters.

 System Status:
	finddbs "throws away" this invalid input and displays the
	I_DU0031_NEWLOC_PROMPT_FI prompt.

 Recommendation:
	The user is given another chance to correctly specify the location name.
	The user may break from the prompt by entering <CR>.  In that case,
	finddbs will stop its search phase and start its analyze phase.


W_DU104A_AREANAME_TOO_LONG_FI


 Parameters:
	None.
 Explanation:
	The user entered the physical mapping for a location that is more than
	128 characters long in response to I_DU0032_LOCAREA_PROMPT_FI prompt.
	Location mappings are limited to 128 characters.

 System Status:
	finddbs "throws away" this invalid input, along with the location name
	specified, and displays the I_DU0031_NEWLOC_PROMPT_FI prompt.

 Recommendation:
	The user is given another chance to correctly specify the location name
	and physical mapping. The user may break from the prompt by entering
	<CR>.  In that case, finddbs will stop its search phase and start its
	analyze phase.


W_DU104B_DUP_LOCATION_FI


 Parameters:
	%0c - location name

 Explanation:
	The user is asking to define a new location, but that location is
	already known to the installation.  Therefore, finddbs refuses to
	operate on this user-defined location.  finddbs does not verify that
	the physical mapping the user specifies matches the mapping in the
	iilocation catalog.  This is done intentionally because finddbs does
	not support remapping/relocation of existing locations.

 System Status:
	finddbs stops operating on the user-specified location and returns to
	the I_DU0031_NEWLOC_PROMPT_FI prompt

 Recommendation:
	The user may specify a different location or may enter <CR> to terminate
	the interactive portion of finddbs.


W_DU104C_INVALID_LOC_FI


 Parameters:
	%0c - location name

 Explanation:
	The user defined an invalid location.  This can be caused by either
	using a non-existent mapping or by using a mapping to a valid location
	that does not contain a data directory.

 System Status:
	finddbs stops operating on the user-specified location and returns to
	the I_DU0031_NEWLOC_PROMPT_FI prompt

 Recommendation:
	The user may specify a different location or may enter <CR> to terminate
	the interactive portion of finddbs.


W_DU104D_DILISTDIR_FAIL_FI


 Parameters:
	%0c - pathname that DIlistdir() failed on
	%1c - location name that maps to %0c

 Explanation:
	finddbs was unable to search this location because of an unexpected
	error returned from DIlistdir().

 System Status:
	finddbs stops operating on this location and goes on to another.

 Recommendation:
	The user should determine what the problem is (usually a VMS system
	logical is not defined, is incorrectly defined, or protections on the
	directory are incorrect).  The user should correct the problem and
	re-run finddbs.


W_DU1062_DBMS60_FAIL


W_DU1080_RUN_DESTROYDB


W_DU1081_CANT_READ_PRODS_LST


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred while trying to open and read the file "prods.lst"
	in the $II_CONFIG/dictfiles directory. Probably there are either 
	missing files in the directory, or protections on "prods.lst" do 
	not allow world READ access; either way, this signals an installation 
	problem.

 System Status:
	This is a warning only; createdb will continue without error, but
	it will only create the front-end catalogs for dictionary client
	'INGRES' (i.e., catalogs for other dictionary clients you are authorized
	to run will not be created).

 Recommendation:
	Check your installation for missing or unreadable files
	in the directory mentioned above.


W_DU1082_STAR_FECAT_WARN


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The user specified frontend clients via the "-f" flag on the createdb
	command line.  However, the user was creating a distributed database,
	so the parameters following the "-f" flag are ignored.

 System Status:
	This is a warning only; createdb will continue without error, but
	it will NOT create the frontend catalogs for any FE clients.

 Recommendation:
	The user should run upgradefe with the same "-f" flag parameters that
	were used with createdb.


W_DU1083_BAD_STARCONNECT


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Some utilities (createdb, upgradedb) need to spawn upgradefe while
	connected to a Star server if they are attempting to operate
	(i.e., create or upgrade) a distributed database.  However, the
	utility could not connect to the Star server.

 System Status:
	Execution continues, but FE catalog operations will be skipped.

 Recommendation:
	The user should verify that the Star server is up and operative in their
	installation.  The user should run upgradefe on their distributed
	database to create/upgrade the FE catalogs.


W_DU1084_NO_FECAT_CRE


 Parameters:
	%0c - distributed database name

 Explanation:
	Some utilities (createdb, upgradedb) need to spawn upgradefe while
	connected to a Star server if they are attempting to operate
	(i.e., create or upgrade) a distributed database.  However, the
	utility could not connect to the Star server.

 System Status:
	Execution continues, but FE catalog creation is skipped.

 Recommendation:
	The user should verify that the Star server is up and operative in their
	installation.  The user should run upgradefe on their distributed
	database to create/upgrade the FE catalogs.


W_DU1085_SORTFLAG_DEPRECATED


 Parameters:
	%0c - location name
 Explanation:
	Now that work locations replace and subsume sort locations, the "-w"
	flag replaces and subsumes the "-s" flag.  But we still accept the
	"-s" flag for backward compatibility.  However, we issue this warning
	so the user can change scripts, etc.

 System Status:
	Warning message only.
 Recommendation:
	If the createdb command was issued from a script, update the script to
	use the "-w" flag instead of a "-s" flag.

S_DU1600_INVALID_RELID


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #1 found an entry in iirelation where reltid=0.  Since
	reltid is used to join the iirelation catalog to other system catalogs
	that are required to retrieve any data from the table (such as
	iiattribute), this tuple is useless.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Recommended action can only be performed in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. The
	recommended action is to delete this tuple from iirelation.  If the
	user does not opt to delete this tuple, s/he can manually modify
	iirelation.reltid to the correct value (if known).  (See DU0301.)


S_DU1601_INVALID_ATTID


 Parameters:
	 %0d - attribute number (from iiattribute.attno)
	 %1c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	 %2c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	 verifydb test #2a found an invalid attno in iiattribute.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Recommended action can only be performed in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. The
	recommended action is to delete this table from the database.  If the
	user does not opt to drop this table, s/he can manually reconstruct
	the iiattribute tuples. (See DU0302.)


S_DU1602_DUPLICATE_ATTIDS


 Parameters:
	 %0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	 %1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)
	 %2d - attribute number (from iiattribute.attno)

 Explanation:
	 verifydb test #2a found more than one tuple with the specified attno.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Recommended action can only be performed in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. The
	recommended action is to delete this table from the database.  If the
	user does not opt to drop this table, s/he can manually reconstruct the
	iiattribute tuples. (See DU0302.)


S_DU1603_MISSING_ATTIDS


 Parameters:
	 %0d - attribute number (from iiattribute.attno)
	 %1c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	 %2c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	 verifydb test #2a found a missing attribute definition for the table.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Recommended action can only be performed in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. The
	recommended action is to delete this table from the database.  If the
	user does not opt to drop this table, s/he can manually reconstruct the
	iiattribute tuples. (See DU0302.)


S_DU1604_ATTID_MISMATCH


 Parameters:
	 %0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	 %1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)
	 %2d - number of attributes (from iirelation.relatts)
	 %3d - largest value of attribute number (from iiattribute.attno)

 Explanation:
	There is a mismatch between the number of columns that iirelation
	indicates the table has and the actual number of columns defined in
	iiattributes.  This is detected by verifydb test #2a.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Recommended action can only be performed in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. The
	recommended action is to delete this table from the database.  If the
	user does not opt to drop this table, s/he can manually reconstruct the
	iiattribute tuples. (See DU0302.)


S_DU1605_INCORRECT_RELWID


 Parameters:
	 %0d - table width from iirelation (iirelation.relwid)
	 %1d - sum of width of each attribute (from each iiattribute.attfrml)
	 %2c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	 %3c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)
 Explanation:
	verifydb test #2b found a mismatch between how large (number of bytes
	of storage) a tuple in the table is and the actual columns defined in
	iiattributes.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Recommended action can only be performed in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. The
	recommended action is to replace iirelation.relatts with the sum of
	each attfrml.  If the user does not opt to do so, s/he can manually
	reconstruct the iiattribute tuples, or drop the table from the database.
	(See DU0303.)


S_DU1606_KEYMISMATCH


 Parameters:
	%0d - columns iirelation indicates there are (iirelation.relkeys)
	%1d - count of number of keys in iiattributes for this table
	      (count(iiattributes.attkey == ISKEY)
	%2c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%3c - tableowner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #3 found a mismatch between the number of columns marked
	as keys in iiattributes and the number of keys that iirelation
	indicates there should be.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Replace iirelation.relkeys with the count of keys defined in
	iiattribute.  If the user is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode and does not
	opt for the recommended action, s/he can manually repair or reconstruct
	the iiattribute tuples, or drop the table from the database.
	No correction is made if verifydb is in REPORT mode.  (See DU0304.)


S_DU1607_INVALID_RELSPEC


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #4 found an invalid relspec in iirelation for this table.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues..

 Recommendation:
	Run verifydb's patchlink function on this table, or drop this table from
	the database.


S_DU1608_MARKED_AS_CATALOG


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #5a found a table marked as a system catalog that does
	not start with "ii", or is not owned by $ingres, or both.

 System Status
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	In RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the user can grant yes/no permission to
	clear the bit in iirelation.  No correction is made if verifydb is
	in REPORT mode.  (See DU030A.)


S_DU1609_NOT_CATALOG


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #5b found a catalog that starts with "ii" but does not
	have iirelation.relstat==CATALOG.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues..

 Recommendation:
	Some tables beginning with ii are permitted from convto60.  The user
	must decide if this is one.  If not, the user may want to manually
	modify iirelation.relstat.


S_DU1610_NO_TABLE_FILE


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #6 found a file was missing.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues, as long as it can before it crashes.
	It should not crash if the missing file is for a user table, but it
	will crash if the missing file is for a core system catalog.

 Recommendation:
	Try to find a backup tape with the disk file if the table should
	have a file (or files, if there are multiple locations) associated with
	it.  If the table is a core catalog and the file cannot be restored or
	recreated, the user has lost all the data in the database.

	If the user cannot recover the disk file for a user table, then only
	the user table is lost, not the whole database.  If verifydb is being
	run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, it will prompt for permission to drop the
	table from the system catalogs.  Such permission should NOT be granted
	until the user is sure that he does not have a backup of the file(s).
	(See DU0302.)


S_DU1611_NO_PROTECTS


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #8 found that there were not really protections defined
	for this table, but iirelation thought that there were.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues..

 Recommendation:
	None required unless running in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, then enter yes/no
	permission for request to clear PRTUPS bit from iirelation.relstat after
	being prompted for permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0305.)


S_DU1612_NO_INTEGS


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #9 found that there were not really integrities defined
	for this table, but iirelation thought that there were.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None required, unless running in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then
	enter yes/no permission for request to clear INTEGS bit from
	iirelation.relstat after being prompted for permission.  

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0306.)


S_DU1613_BAD_CONCUR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #10 found that a table that is not a DBMS core catalog
	was marked for special core-catalog locking, which blocks out
	no_read_lock users while the catalog is being updated.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None required, unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then enter
	yes/no permission to clear the CONCUR bit from iirelation.relstat --
	the answer should be yes, unless the table is one of: iirelation;
	iirel_idx; iiattribute; iiindex; iidevices.  If the table is one of
	these, and verifydb outputs this message, then there is a serious
	problem.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0307.)


S_DU1614_MISSING_CONCUR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #11 found that one of the DBMS core catalogs is not
	marked for the special locking that keeps no_read_lock users from
	accessing the catalog while it is being updated.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None required, unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then enter
	yes/no permission to set the CONCUR bit from iirelation.relstat --
	the answer should be yes, if the table is one of: iirelation;
	iirel_idx; iiattribute; iiindex; iidevices.  If the table is not
	one of these, and verifydb outputs this message, then there is a
	serious problem.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0308.)


S_DU1615_NOT_VIEW


 Parameters:
	%0c - view/table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - view/table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #12 found that there is a physical disk file associated
	with this view's reltid -- and views never have physical tables
	associated with them.  Besides, there is no entry in iitree for
	this view.  Therefore, it is either a table that has been mismarked
	as a view, or someone has inadvertently changed file names and
	iitree has lost some of its tuples.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If the user is not running in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, verifydb
	automatically changes iirelation to assume this is a table,
	not a view.  If verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, then the
	user must grant yes/no permission to redefine the view to be a table.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0309.)


S_DU1616_MISSING_VIEW_DEF


 Parameters:
	%0c - view name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - view owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #12 could not find the view definition for this view.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If verifydb is not in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, it automatically drops this
	view from the system.  Otherwise, the user must give yes/no permission
	to drop this view from the system.

	No correction is made if verifydb is in REPORT mode.  (See DU030B.)


S_DU1617_NO_DBDEPENDS


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #13 found that the view was not shown in iidbdepends;
	therefore, the DBMS can't trace the view back to the table(s) it's based
	on.  This means there is no way to verify that the base table for the
	view really exists.
	If the view really does not depend on any tables, this situation
	is normal and correct.  However, if the view is defined on one
	or more tables, the view definition is damaged.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Verifydb will not correct this warning automatically, since it
	cannot determine whether the view is supposed to be defined on
	base table(s).  The DBA should examine the view definition and
	drop/recreate the view, unless it is a constant view.


S_DU1618_NO_QUERYTEXT


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #14 found that the query text (which defined the view)
	is not in iiqrytext table.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb only prints a warning message, so there is no user action
	required.  However, the user may want to drop this view and redefine
	it, so that the query test is defined.


S_DU1619_NO_VIEW	


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #15 found that iirelation believes this is a base table
	for a view, but there is no view defined that uses this table as part
	(or all) of the view base.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If verifydb is not in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, it automatically clears the
	VBASE bit from iirelation.relstat.  Otherwise, it prompts the user for
	permission to do so.  The user must give yes/no permission -- usually
	s/he should give yes in this case.  If the user wants to recreate
	the view, s/he can get the view definition from iiqrytext.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU030C.)


S_DU161A_NO_BASE_FOR_INDEX


 Parameters:
	%0c - index table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - index table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #16 found that this index table is useless, because
	the base table that it describes does not exist.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically drop the index table unless in
	RUNINTERACTIVE mode, where it will prompt the user for permission
	to drop the table.  In this case, the user must give yes/no permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0302.)


S_DU161B_NO_2NDARY


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid for base table)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner for base table)
	%2c - index table name (from iirelation.relid for index table)
	%3c - index table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #17 found that the iirelation entry for a base table did
	not indicate there is a secondary index table for this table.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless running in RUNINTERACTIVE mode -- then give yes/no
	permission to set IDXD bit in iirelation.relstat for base table.

	No correction can be  made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU030D.)


S_DU161C_WRONG_NUM_INDEXES


 Parameters:
	%0d - number of index tables iirelation thinks there are (from
		iirelation.relidxcount)
	%1c - base table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%2c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)
	%3d - actual number of index tables defined in iiindex

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #18 found that iirelation thinks there are more secondary
	indexes defined for this table than really exist.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode -- then give yes/no
	permission to change the value of iirelation.relidxcount.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU030E.)


S_DU161D_NO_INDEXS


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid for base table)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner for base table)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #18 found that iirelation thinks there are secondary
	indexes defined for this table, but none exist.

	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #26 found a table definition in iirelation that
	does not have a corresponding entry in iirel_idx.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None is required, unless verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. Then
	the user must give yes/no permission to create a tuple in iirel_idx
	for this table.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode.


S_DU1625_MISSING_IIRELATION


 Parameters:

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #27 found an entry in the index table for a
	nonexistent table -- i.e., there is no corresponding entry in
	iirelation for this table.

 System Status:
*The verifydb process continues.
 Recommendation:
	None is required, unless verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. Then
	the user must give yes/no permission to drop this tuple from iirel_idx.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode.


S_DU1626_INVALID_ATTRELID


 Parameters:
	%0c - attrelid from iiattributes
	%1c - attrelidx from iiattributes

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #28 found some tuples in iiattributes that have table ID
	and index table ID values that do not match any entries in iirelation.
	this means that they are useless, and should be deleted.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user must give yes/no permission to drop these tuples from
	iiattribute.  The user may want to construct an iirelation tuple
	manually, rather than to delete these tuples from iiattribute.
	NOTE: verifydb will not take any corrective action for this situation
	unless it is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, and "yes" permission has been
	granted. (See DU0317.)


S_DU1627_INVALID_ATTFMT


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)
	%2d - column number (from iiattribute.attid)
	%3d - numeric value of iiattribute.attfrmt

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #29 found an invalid attribute format specification for
	one of the columns.  It must be one of: INTEGER; FLOAT; C; TEXT; DATA;
	MONEY; CHAR; or VCHAR.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the user must give yes/no
	permission to drop table from database.  If the user withholds
	permission or verifydb is being run in another mode, the user may
	want to manually update iiattribute.attfrmt.  Valid values are:
                          Nullable     Not Nullable
	    INTEGER           -30             30
	    FLOAT             -31             31
	    C                 -32             32
	    TEXT              -37             37
	    DATE               -3              3
	    MONEY              -5              5

	    VCHAR             -21             21

	(See DU0302.)


S_DU1628_INVALID_BASEID


 Parameters:
	%0c - baseid from iiindex
	%1c - indexid from iiindex

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #30 found some tuples in iiindex that have table ID
	and index table ID values that do not match any entries in iirelation.
	this means that they are useless, and should be deleted.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user must give yes/no permission to drop these tuples from iiindex.
	The user may want to construct an iirelation tuple manually, rather than
	to delete these tuples from iiindex.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0318.)


S_DU1629_IS_INDEX


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid for base table)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner for base table)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #31 found that the iirelation entry did not mark this
	as a secondary index table, but it is one.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless running in RUNINTERACTIVE mode -- then give yes/no
	permission to set INDEX bit in iirelation.relstat for this index table.
	(See DU0319.)


S_DU162A_INVALID_INDEXKEYS


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid for base table)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner for base table)
	%2d - invalid idom element in iiindex table
	      (where value is > #columns in base table).

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #32 found that one of the table columns marked as a key
	is invalid, because its value is larger than the number of columns in 
	the table.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless running in RUNINTERACTIVE mode -- then give yes/no
	permission to drop this index table. (See DU0302.)


S_DU162B_INVALID_DEVRELIDX


 Parameters:
	%0c - devrelid from iidevices
	%1c - devrelidx from iidevices

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #33 found some tuples in iidevices that have table ID
	and index table ID values that do not match any entries in iirelation.
	this means that they are useless, and should be deleted.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user must give yes/no permission to drop these tuples from
	iidevices.  The user may want to construct an iirelation tuple
	manually, rather than to delete these tuples from iidevices.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU031A.)


S_DU162C_LOCATIONS_EXIST


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #34 found locations for this table defined in iidevices,
	but iirelation.relstat.MUTLIPLE_LOC was set to false.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically set the MULTIPLE_LOC bit in iirelation's
	relstat, unless verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode -- then the user
	must grant yes/no permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU031B.)


S_DU162D_UNKNOWN_TREEMODE


 Parameters:
	%0d - base table ID associated with tree (from iitree.treetabbase)
	%1d - base table index ID associated with tree (from iitree.treetabidx)
	%2c - table/view name (from iirelation.relid)
	%3c - table/view owner (from iirelation.relowner)
	%4d - mode value (from iitree.treemode)

 Explanation:
	verifydb found an entry in iitree that has a mode unknown to
	the DBMS.  Of course, it is possible that new tree entries will be
	created in later versions of the database (greater than 6.1) and
	an older version of verifydb is being run.  Therefore, the correction
	of deleting these tuples from the tree will only be performed in
	interactive mode.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Give yes/no permission to delete these tuples from iitree.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU031C.)


S_DU162E_INVALID_TREEID


 Parameters:
	%0d - base table ID associated with tree (from iitree.treetabbase)
	%1d - base table index ID associated with tree (from iitree.treetabidx)
	%2c - table/view name (from iirelation.relid)
	%3c - table/view name (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb found a tree ID that is invalid.  Since treeid is how
	other system catalogs reference this tree, this tree cannot be used by
	the DBMS.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If the user knows the correct tree ID value, s/he can replace in it the
	effected iitree tuples.  In such a case, s/he should give no permission
	to delete the tuples (RUNINTERACTIVE mode only).  Otherwise, the
	tuples will be removed from iitree, and the user can get the original
	query text from iiqrytext. (See DU031C.)


S_DU162F_NO_TREEBASE


 Parameters:
	%0d - base table ID associated with tree (from iitree.treetabbase)
	%1d - base table index ID associated with tree (from iitree.treetabidx)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #35 could not find an entry in iirelation with the same
	(base, index) ID.  Views, permits, and integrities are tied to
	an entry in iirelation, so if this tree defines a view, an integrity,
	or a permit, it is useless and should be dropped.  Stored procedures are
	not tied to an entry in iirelation.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically delete the tuples from iitree, unless
	verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, in which case it will prompt
	the user for yes/no permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU031C.)


S_DU1630_NO_VIEW_RELSTAT


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #38 found the iirelation tuple for the iitree entry did
	not indicate that this is a view.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Unless verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the correction of setting
	the VIEW bit in iirelation.relstat is automatically performed.  If not,
	then the user must give yes/no permission to make this correction when
	prompted.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU031D.)


S_DU1631_NO_PROTECT_RELSTAT


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1s - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #38 found the iirelation tuple for the iitree entry did
	not indicate that this table has protections defined for it, or
	verifydb test #45 found the iirelation tuple for this permission did not
	indicate that this table has permissions defined for it.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Unless verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the correction of setting
	the PRTUPS bit in iirelation.relstat is automatically performed. If not,**	then the user must give yes/no permission to make this correction when
	prompted.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU031E.)


S_DU1632_NO_INTEGS_RELSTAT


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #38 found the iirelation tuple for the iitree entry did
	not indicate that this table has integrities defined for it, or
	verifydb test #41 found the iirelation tuple for this integrity did not
	indicate that this table has integrities defined for it.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Unless verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the correction of setting
	the INTEGS bit in iirelation.relstat is automatically performed. If not,**	then the user must give yes/no permission to make this correction when
	prompted.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU031F.)


S_DU1633_MISSING_TREE_SEQ


 Parameters:
	%0d - high portion of tree ID (from iitree.treeid1)
	%1d - low portion of tree ID (from iitree.treeid2)
	%2c - table/view name (from iirelation.relid)
	%3c - table/view owner (from iirelation.relowner)
	%4d - missing sequence number

 Explanation:
	A tree entry may be comprised of more than one tuple in iitree. In such
	a case, each tree entry has identical treetabbase, treetabidx, treeid1
	and treeid2 values, but has unique (and sequential) treeseq values.
	verifydb test #39 determined that one (or more) of the expected treeseq
	values are missing.  NOTE: verifydb cannot determine if the last (or
	last N) tuples are missing from the tree, as there is no place in iitree
	that gives a count of the number of tree tuples expected.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically drop the tree tuples from iitree unless in
	RUNINTERACTIVE mode, where user must give yes/no permission for such
	a fix.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU031C.)


S_DU1634_NO_BASE_FOR_INTEG


 Parameters:
	%0d - base table ID (from iiintegrity.inttabbase)
	%1d - index table ID (from iiintegrity.inttabidx)

 Explanation:

	this integrity doesn't exist (at least it's not listed in iirelation.)

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically drop all tuples with this base,index
	ID from iiintegrity unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode -- then the
	user must enter YES/NO permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0320.)


S_DU1635_NO_TREE_FOR_INTEG


 Parameters:
	%0d - high portion of treeid (from iiintegrity.inttreeid1)
	%1d - low portion of treeid (from iiintegrity.inttreeid2)
	%2c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%3c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #42 found that the tree that defines this integrity
	does not exist.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically drop all tuples with this base,index
	ID from iiintegrity unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode -- then the user
	must enter YES/NO permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0320.)

	integrity does not exist.  This does not hurt DBMS functioning, but it
	affects some utility routines.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to drop this integrity and redefine it, if s/he knows
	what the definition should be.


S_DU1637_NO_BASE_FOR_PERMIT


 Parameters:
	%0d - base table ID (from iiprotect.protabbase)
	%1d - index table ID (from iiprotect.protabidx)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #44 found that the table that is supposed to receive
	this permit doesn't exist (at least it's not listed in iirelation.)

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically drop all tuples with this base,index
	ID from iipermit unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode -- then the user must
	enter YES/NO permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0321.)


S_DU1638_NO_TREE_FOR_PERMIT

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically drop all tuples with this base,index
	ID from iipermit unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode -- then the user must
	enter YES/NO permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0321.)


S_DU1639_NO_PERMIT_QRYTEXT


 Parameters:
	%0d - high portion of qryid (from iiprotect.proqryid1)
	%1d - low portion of qryid (from iiprotect.proqryid2)
	%2c - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%3c - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #44 found that the query text used to define this 
	permit does not exist.  This does not hurt DBMS functioning, but it
	affects some utility routines.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to drop this permit and redefine it, if s/he knows
	what the definition should be.


S_DU163A_UNKNOWN_QRYMODE


 Parameters:
	%0d - low portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid1)
	%1d - high portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid2)
	%2d - query mode (from iiqrytext.mode)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #48 found an entry in iiqrytext that has a mode unknown 
	to the DBMS.  This is informational only, as the DBMS server does not
	act on iiqrytext.  However, some DBMS utilities do act on it.  If 
	possible, it is best to drop the view, permit, integrity, or stored
	procedure and recreate it.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU163B_INVALID_QRYTEXT_ID


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #49 found an entry in iiqrytext that has an invalid
	query id of txtid1=0 and txtid2=0.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None required; however, the user may want to manually drop these tuples
	from iiqrytext.  The user may want to examine the txt field and
	determine what txtid1 and txtid2 should be and manually correct them.


S_DU163C_QRYTEXT_VIEW_MISSING


 Parameters:
	%0d - low portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid1)
	%1d - high portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid2)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #50 was unable to find the view definition in iirelation
	that corresponds to this view querytext. This is informational only, 
	as the DBMS Server does not act on iiqrytext.  However, the user may
	want to redefine the view to the database.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU163D_QRYTEXT_PERMIT_MISSING


 Parameters:
	%0d - low portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid1)
	%1d - high portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid2)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #50 was unable to find the permit definition in iirelation
	that corresponds to this permit querytext. This is informational only, 
	as the DBMS server does not act on iiqrytext.  However, the user may
	want to redefine the permit to the database.  It is possible that the
	table the permit is for does not exist in the database, but verifydb
	is not able to determine this, as iiqrytext does not have the
	equivalent of reltid and reltidx.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU163E_QRYTEXT_INTEG_MISSING


 Parameters:
	%0d - low portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid1)
	%1d - high portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid2)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #50 was unable to find the integrity definition in 
	iirelation that corresponds to this integrity querytext. This is 
	informational only, as the DBMS server does not act on iiqrytext.  
	However, the user may want to redefine the integrity to the database.  
	It is possible that the table the integrity is for does not exist in 
	the database, but verifydb is not able to determine this, as iiqrytext 
	does not have the equivalent of reltid and reltidx.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU163F_QRYTEXT_DBP_MISSING


 Parameters:
	%0d - low portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid1)
	%1d - high portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid2)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #52b was unable to find the database procedure definition
	in iitree that corresponds to this DBP querytext. This is 
	informational only, as the DBMS server does not act on iiqrytext.  
	However, the user may want to redefine the DBP to the database.  

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU1640_NONEXISTENT_DEID


 Parameters:
	%0d - dependent table id (from iidbdepends.deid1)
	%1d - dependent table index id (from iidbdepends.deid2)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #54 found an entry in iidbdepends that describes a
	view or table with permit as dependent on another table.  However,
	the dependent table/view does not exist (or is not defined in
	iirelation).

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically delete the iidbdepends tuple, unless it is
	in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then it will prompt the user for yes/no
	permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0322.)


S_DU1641_NONEXISTENT_INDEP_TBL


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name from iirelation.relid (of iirelation that matches
		on deid1 and deid2)
	%1c - table owner from iirelation.relowner (of iirelation that matches
		on deid1 and deid2)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #55 found an entry in iidbdepends that describes a
	view or table with permit as dependent on another table.  However,
	the table/view that it is dependent on does not exist (or is not 
	defined in iirelation)

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically delete the iidbdepends tuple, unless it is
	in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then it will prompt the user for yes/no
	permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0322.)


S_DU1642_INID_NO_VBASE


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name from iirelation.relid (of iirelation 
		that matches on inid1 and inid2)
	%1c - table owner from iirelation.relid (of 
		iirelation that matches on inid1 and inid2)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #56 found an entry in iidbdepends that describes a
	view as dependent on another table.  However, the table/view that it 
	is dependent does not indicate that there is a view based on it.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically set the VBASE bit in iirelation/relstat of
	the independent table/view, unless it is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. Then
	it will prompt the user for yes/no permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0323.)


S_DU1643_DEPENDENT_NOT_VIEW


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name from iirelation.relid (of iirelation that matches
		on deid1 and deid2)
	%1c - table owner from iirelation.relowner (of iirelation that matches
		on deid1 and deid2)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #57 found an entry in iidbdepends that describes a
	view as dependent on another table.  However, the iirelation entry for
	this dependent view does not indicate that this is a view.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically set the VBASE bit in iirelation/relstat of
	the independent table/view, unless it is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. Then
	it will prompt the user for yes/no permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode.  (See DU031D.)


S_DU1644_MISSING_IIXDBDEPENDS


 Parameters:
	%0c - independent table name
	%1c - independent table owner
	%2c - dependent table name
	%3c - dependent table owner

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #58 found a table definition in iidbdepends that
	does not have a corresponding entry in iixdbdepends.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None is required, unless verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode -- then
	user must give yes/no permission to create a tuple in iixdbdepends for
	this table.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0324.)


S_DU1645_MISSING_IIDBDEPENDS


 Parameters:
	%0d -- dependent table ID (from iidbdpends.deid1)
	%1d -- dependent table index ID (from iidbdpends.deid2)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #59 found an entry in the index table for a
	nonexistent table -- i.e., there is no corresponding entry
	in iidbdepends for this table.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None is required, unless verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode -- then
	the user must give yes/no permission to drop this tuple from
	iixdbdepends.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0325.)


S_DU1646_INVALID_STATISTIC_COL


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - table owner

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #64 found that the statistics for this table were
	performed on an invalid column number.  Since the utility that gathers
	these statistics would not gather statistics on a non-existent column,
	this indicates that the iistatistics table has probably been 
	corrupted.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	The best user action is to re-run the optimizedb utility.  However,
	verifydb will attempt to patch up the iistatistics table by deleting the
	appropriate tuple(s) from iistatistics, unless it is in RUNINTERACTIVE
	mode.  Then the user must supply yes/no permission to perform the fix.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0326.)


S_DU1647_NO_OPSTAT_IN_BASE


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - table owner

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #62 found that the iirelation entry for the table
	that these statistics are based on does not indicate that there
	are statistics for this table -- (i.e., iirelation.relstat's OPTSTAT
	bit flag is not set).

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Unless verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, it will automatically
	set the iirelation.relstat's OPTSTAT bit.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0327.)


S_DU1648_MISSING_HISTOGRAM


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - table owner
	%2d - attribute number
	%3d - number of cells iistatistics thinks there are 
		(from iistatistics.snumcells)
	%4d - number of cells iihistogram has (actual count of tuples)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #64 found that table iistatistics indicate there is a
	histogram for this table, but no histogram can be found in iihistogram.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Unless verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, it will automatically
	modify the tuple in iistatistics to stop indicating that there is a
	histogram.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode.  (See DU0328.)


S_DU1649_STATS_ON_INDEX


 Parameters:
	%0c - index table name 
	%1c - index table owner
	%2d - base table ID (from iihistogram.htabbase)
	%3d - index table ID (from iihistogram.htabindex)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #61 found statistics defined on an index table.  This
	is not allowed.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically drop all tuples with this base,index
	ID from iistatistics, unless it is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. Then
	the user must enter YES/NO permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0326.)


S_DU164A_NO_STATS_FOR_HISTOGRAM


 Parameters:
	%0d - base table ID (from iihistogram.htabbase)
	%1d - index table ID (from iihistogram.htabindex)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #65 could not find the entry in iistatistics for this
	histogram.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically drop all tuples with this base,index
	ID from iihistogram, unless it is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then
	the user must enter YES/NO permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode.  (See DU0329.)


S_DU164B_HISTOGRAM_SEQUENCE_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - table owner 
	%2d - attribute number
	%3d - missing sequence number

 Explanation:
	A histogram entry may be comprised of more than one tuple in
	iihistogram. In such a case, each histogram entry has unique
	(and sequential) hsequence values.

	verifydb test #66 determined that one (or more) of the expected
	sequence values are missing.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user should probably rerun the optimizedb utility to regenerate this
	histogram.  verifydb will delete the histogram tuples from iihistogram,
	unless it is being run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. Then the user must
	input Yes/No.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode.  (See DU0329.)


S_DU164C_NO_BASE_FOR_STATS


 Parameters:
	%0d - base table ID (from iistatistics.stabbase)
	%1d - index table ID (from iistatistics.stabindex)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #60 found that the table that these statistics are
	compiled for doesn't exist (at least it's not listed in iirelation.)

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically drop all tuples with this base,index
	ID from iistatistics, unless it is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. Then
	the user must enter YES/NO permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0326.)


S_DU164D_INVAL_SYS_CAT_RELSPEC


 Parameters:
	%0c - DBMS system catalog name
	%1d - invalid relspec value (from iirelation.relspec)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #4 found a system catalog with an invalid relspec.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically set the relspec to the correct value,
	unless it is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then the user must enter
	YES/NO permission.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU032A
	and DU032B.)


S_DU164E_DUPLICATE_TREE_SEQ


 Parameters:
	%0d - high portion of tree ID (from iitree.treeid1)
	%1d - low portion of tree ID (from iitree.treeid2)
	%2c - table/view name (from iirelation.relid)
	%3c - table/view owner (from iirelation.relowner)
	%4d - duplicate sequence number

 Explanation:
	A tree entry may be comprised of more than one tuple in iitree. In such
	a case, each tree entry has identical treetabbase, treetabidx, treeid1
	and treeid2 values, but has unique (and sequential) treeseq values.

	verifydb test #39 determined that one (or more) of the expected treeseq
	values are duplicated.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically drop the tree tuples from iitree, unless
	it is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, where the user must give yes/no
	permission for such a fix.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU031C.)


S_DU164F_QRYTEXT_SEQUENCE_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0d - high portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid1)
	%1d - low portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid2)
	%2d - missing sequence number

 Explanation:
	A query entry may be comprised of more than one tuple in iiqrytext.  
	In such a case, each query entry has identical txtid1, txtid2, and
	mode values, but has unique (and sequential) seq values.

	verifydb test #53 determined that one (or more) of the expected sequence
	values are missing.  NOTE: verifydb cannot determine if the last (or
	last N) tuples are missing from the query, as there is no place in 
	iiqrytext that gives a count of the number of query tuples expected.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None required; however, the user may want to manually fix this, if the
	user knows how the query should read.  The user may want to delete the
	other tuples for this query, if the user does not know how query should
	read.


S_DU1650_QRYTEXT_DUP_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0d - high portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid1)
	%1d - low portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid2)
	%2d - missing sequence number

 Explanation:
	A query entry may be comprised of more than one tuple in iiqrytext.  
	In such a case, each query entry has identical txtid1, txtid2, and
	mode values, but has unique (and sequential) sequence values.

	verifydb test #53 determined that one (or more) of the expected seq
	values are duplicated.  NOTE: verifydb cannot determine if the last (or
	last N) tuples are missing from the query, as there is no place in 
	iiqrytext that gives a count of the number of query tuples expected.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None required; however, the user may want to fix manually, if the user
	knows how the query should read.  The user may want to delete the other
	tuples for this query, if the user does not know how the query should
	read.


S_DU1651_INVALID_IIHISTOGRAM


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The tuples in iihistogram are used in conjunction with tuples in
	iistatistics.  If there are no tuples in iistatistics, then all of
	the tuples in iihistogram are meaningless.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues. However, it is unable to check each
	tuple in iihistogram, because the iihistogram logic requires the
	iistatistics cache, and there is no cache for iistatistics. Therefore,
	verifydb does not check the status of each tuple in iihistogram.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will automatically delete all tuples from iihistogram
	in RUN or RUNSILENT modes.  It will prompt the user for permission
	to drop all iihistogram tuples in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  The user
	must give or withhold permission.


S_DU1652_HISTOGRAM_DUP_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - table owner 
	%2d - attribute number
	%3d - missing sequence number

 Explanation:
	A histogram entry may be comprised of more than one tuple in
	iihistogram. In such a case, each histogram entry has unique
	(and sequential) hsequence values.

	verifydb test #66 determined that one (or more) of the expected sequence
	values are missing.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user should probably rerun the optimizedb utility to regenerate this
	histogram.  verifydb will delete the histogram tuples from iihistogram
	unless it is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then the user must input Yes/No.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU0329.)


S_DU1653_RUN_VERIFYDB


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
	verifydb is dropping this table.  This will leave the database in an
	inconsistent state, because there will be a dependency on this table
	in the system.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user must run verifydb to clean up any inconsistencies left over
	after this table is dropped.


S_DU1654_INVALID_USERNAME


 Parameters:
	%0c -- user name

 Explanation:
	The user name has characters in it which are not legal for a
	user name.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	The system administrator should run accessdb to see if any users have
	been dropped.  If so, use accessdb to redefine them.


S_DU1655_INVALID_USERSTAT


 Parameters:
	%0c - user name

 Explanation:
	iiuser.status has invalid bits set.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will clear invalid bits.  However, there is a good chance that
	the user's permissions may not be right if there were invalid bits in
	the permission bitmap.  The system administrator should run accessdb to
	assure that the user has correct permissions.


S_DU1656_INVALID_DBNAME


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%0c - DBA

 Explanation:
	The name of the database has been corrupted.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will ask for permission to remove this tuple from iidatabase.
	In this case, the user should run finddbs to get the database back.
	However, the user must know which locations to tell finddbs to search
	and may also need to use accessdb to assign correct privileges to the 
	database.


S_DU1657_INVALID_DBDEV


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - DBA
	%2c - default location name (from iidatabase.dbdev)

 Explanation:
	The database's default data location is not known to the installation.
	This means that the server will not be able to find the database.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will ask for permission to remove this tuple from iidatabase.
	If the user thinks that the location is valid, they should withhold
	permission to drop this database.  Then they should add the location
	via accessdb.


S_DU1658_INVALID_DBDEV


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - database owner

 Explanation:
	The database's owner is not a valid user.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will ask for permission to remove this tuple from iidatabase.
	If the user thinks that the owner should exist, they should not give
	permission to delete the database and should use accessdb to define
	the owner as a valid user.


S_DU1659_MISSING_IIEXTEND


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - database owner
	%2c - default location

 Explanation:
	Every database has at least one entry in iiextend for its default
	location.  There should be an entry for this database (its default
	location has already been validated), but there is not.  The correct
	fix is to put the default location (from iidatabase.dbdev) into the
	iiextend table.  verifydb will automatically do this for the user 
	unless it is being run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  In that case, the
	user will be prompted for yes/no permission.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	No action is required unless verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. In
	that case, the user must enter Yes/No permission before verifydb will
	take any action.


S_DU165A_INVALID_CKPDEV


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name (from iidatabase.name)
	%1c - DBA (from iidatabase.own)
	%2c - checkpoint location name (from iidatabase.ckpdev)

 Explanation:
	The database's checkpoint location in not known to the installation.
	This means that the server will not be able to checkpoint this database.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will ask for permission to remove this tuple from iidatabase.
	If the user thinks that the location is valid, they should withhold
	permission to drop this database.  Then they should go in via
	accessdb and add the location.


S_DU165B_INVALID_JNLDEV


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name (from iidatabase.name)
	%1c - DBA (from iidatabase.own)
	%2c - journal location name (from iidatabase.jnldev)

 Explanation:
	The database's journal location in not known to the installation.
	This means that the server will not be able to keep a journaling log
	for this database.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will ask for permission to remove this tuple from iidatabase.
	If the user thinks that the location is valid, they should withhold
	permission to drop this database.  Then they should go in via
	accessdb and add the location.


S_DU165C_INVALID_SORTDEV


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name (from iidatabase.name)
	%1c - DBA (from iidatabase.own)
	%2c - work location name (from iidatabase.sortdev)

 Explanation:
	The database's work location in not known to the installation.
	This means that the server will not be able to use temporary storage
      for temp tables and sorts for this database.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	verifydb will ask for permission to remove this tuple from iidatabase.
	If the user thinks that the location is valid, they should withhold
	permission to drop this database.  Then they should go in via
	accessdb and add the location.


S_DU165D_DBA_HAS_NO_ACCESS


 Parameters:
	%0c - database owner
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
	The only way to access a private database is to be explicitly
	permitted to access the database via a tuple in iidbaccess. createdb 
	puts a tuple in iidbaccess for the DBA of a private database at
	creation time.  Any other users are given access to that database via
	the accessdb utility.

	It is not reasonable for the owner of the private database to be
	denied access to that database. Therefore, the missing iidbaccess tuple
	must be an error, and verifydb will automatically correct that,
	unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  In that case, the user will be 
	prompted for yes/no permission.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	No action is required unless verifydb is in RUNINTERACTIVE mode. In
	that case, the user must enter Yes/No permission before verifydb will
	take any action.


S_DU165E_BAD_DB


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - database owner

 Explanation:
	The database is not usable.  Either createdb failed, or destroydb
	failed.  In either case, the user should run destroydb to remove
	it from the installation.  If they want a database by that name, they
	can use createdb to re-create it after they have destroyed the
	inoperative version.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	No action is required.  However, the user may want to remove the
	inoperative database from the installation with destroydb.


S_DU165F_UNCONVERTED_DB


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - database owner

 Explanation:
	The database is not compatible with the installation's server.
	The user may want to convert the database, or they may want to
	leave it at its current level.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	No action is required.


S_DU1660_INCOMPATIBLE_DB


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - database owner

 Explanation:
	The database is not marked as operative, or as a conversion candidate,
	and the database compatibility level is not valid.  This is a very
	serious corruption.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Try running "finddbs -r".  If that does not pick up the database
	correctly, get the database back from a checkpoint/rollforward.
	If there was not any checkpoint/journaling on the database, the
	user should call Ingres Corporation Technical Support for help. 
	They may be able to manipulate the iidbdb catalogs to permit 
	the server to access the database.  IMPORTANT: In this case it 
	is a must to unload the database, destroy it, recreate it, and 
	reload it.


S_DU1661_INOPERATIVE_DB


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - database owner

 Explanation:
	The database is not marked operative, but there is not any apparent
	reason why it should not be marked operative.  However, a database may
	only be marked operative in RUNINTERACTIVE mode if the user gives YES
	permission.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user must give Yes/No permission in response to the prompt.


S_DU1662_INCOMPAT_MINOR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - database owner
	%2d - minor compatibility level

 Explanation:
	The database has an unreasonable minor compatibility level.  The minor
	compatibility level is how the server keeps track of what the latest 
	changes in the database are.

	This can be a serious or trivial problem, depending on the reason the
	compatibility level is invalid.  The first thing to verify is that
	the user is running with the correct version of verifydb.  This is the
	most likely reason for this type of error, if there is not any other
	corruption to the iidatabase table.

	If the user is running with the correct version of verifydb, then
	the user should delete this tuple from iidatabase and run "finddbs -r"
	to get the information back from the config file.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Try running "finddbs -r".  If that does not pick up the database
	correctly, get the database back from a checkpoint/rollforward.
	If there was not any checkpoint/journaling on the database, the
	user should call Ingres Corporation Technical Support for assistance. 


S_DU1663_ZERO_DBID


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - database owner

 Explanation:
	Each database should have a unique, nonzero database ID.  The server
	uses the database ID to keep track of which database is associated with
	a specific processing thread.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Try running "finddbs -r".  If that does not pick up the database
	correctly, get the database back from a checkpoint/rollforward.


S_DU1664_DUPLICATE_DBID


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - database owner
	%2d - database ID

 Explanation:
	Each database should have a unique, nonzero database ID.  The server
	uses the database ID to keep track of which database is associated with
	a specific processing thread.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Try running "finddbs -r".  If that does not pick up the database
	correctly, get the database back from a checkpoint/rollforward.


S_DU1665_NO_2NDARY_INDEX


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - database owner

 Explanation:
	The iidatabase table has a secondary index named iidbid_idx.  Each tuple
	in iidatabase must have a corresponding entry in iidbid_idx.  Either the
	entry is missing, or the tidp for the entry is incorrect.  In either
	case, iidbid_idx must be updated to match iidatabase.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then then user must give Yes/No
	permission before verifydb can take corrective action.


S_DU1666_NO_IIDATABASE_ENTRY


 Parameters:
	%0d - database ID (from iidbid_idx.db_id)

 Explanation:
	The iidatabase table has a secondary index named iidbid_idx.  Each tuple
	in iidatabase must have a corresponding entry in iidbid_idx.  Each tuple
	in iidbid_idx must have a corresponding entry in iidatabase.  In this
	case, there was a tuple in iidbid_idx with no corresponding tuple in
	iidatabase; verifydb will remove the entry form iidbid_idx.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then the user must give Yes/No
	permission before verifydb can take corrective action.


S_DU1667_WRONG_IIDBIDIDX_TID


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name (from iidatabase.name)
	%1c - database owner (from iidatabase.own)
	%1d - TID associated with iidatabase tuple
	%2d - iidbid_idx.tidp 

 Explanation:
	The iidatabase table has a secondary index named iidbid_idx.  Each tuple
	in iidatabase must have a corresponding entry in iidbid_idx.  Each tuple
	in iidbid_idx must have a corresponding entry in iidatabase.  In this
	case, there was a tuple in iidbid_idx had the wrong value for the TID
	pointer; verifydb will update iidbid_idx.tidp to the correct value.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then the user must give Yes/No
	permission before verifydb can take corrective action.


S_DU1668_NONUSER_WITH_ACCESS


 Parameters:
	%1c - private database name (from iidbaccess.dbname)
	%0c - user (from iidbaccess.usrname)

 Explanation:
	Table iidbaccess is used to specify which users should have
	access to a private database.  In this case, one of the users specified
	is not a valid user in this installation.  verifydb will
	automatically remove access for this nonexistent user from this
	database, unless it is being run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then the user must give Yes/No
	permission before verifydb can take corrective action.


S_DU1669_NOSUCH_DB


 Parameters:
	%0c - user (from iidbaccess.usrname)
	%1c - private database name (from iidbaccess.dbname)

 Explanation:
	Table iidbaccess is used to specify which users should have
	access to a private database.  In this case, the specified database
	does not exist in this installation. verifydb will automatically
	remove access for this user to the nonexistent database, unless it
	is being run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then the user must give Yes/No
	permission before verifydb can take corrective action.


S_DU166A_PRIV_NOT_GLOBAL


 Parameters:
	%0c - user (from iidbaccess.usrname)
	%1c - private database name (from iidbaccess.dbname)

 Explanation:
	Table iidbaccess is used to specify which users should have
	access to a private database.  In this case, there is an entry in
	iidbaccess for the owner of the database, which indicates a private
	database.  However, the iidatabase has this database marked as GLOBAL
	(public).  The database should be private if there is a valid entry for
	it in iidbaccess.

	verifydb will automatically mark the database as a private database,
	unless it is being run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then the user must give Yes/No
	permission before verifydb can take corrective action.


S_DU166B_INVALID_LOCNAME


 Parameters:
	%0c - location logical name (from iilocations.lname)
	%1c - physical translation of logical location name
		(from iilocations.area)

 Explanation:
	Table iilocation keeps a list of location names and what
	these names translate to.  The user never refers to the translated
	name, they always use the logical name to refer to a location. accessdb
	is the only utility that permits a user to associate logical and
	physical names.  accessdb puts the logical/physical pair into the
	config file when a database is extended to a specific location.  It
	uses the iilocations tuple to get logical/physical values for this
	location.

	In this case, the logical name has been corrupted to the point that
	the DBMS cannot use it to look up the physical area associated with the
	logical.

	verifydb will automatically remove the tuple from iilocations, unless
	it is being run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  It will print the physical
	name (or area) associated with the logical in the verifydb log.  The
	user should use accessdb to redefine the location.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the user must give Yes/No permission
	before verifydb can take corrective action.

	After the corrective action is taken, the user should use accessdb to
	redefine the location.  NOTE: Because the location information is in
	the config file, the user must use the same logical/physical
	names that the location was previously defined at.  If the user
	does not know how the location should be defined, they should do
	an ASCII dump on the config file to find out.  The config file resides
	in the database's default data location and is file aaaaaaaa.cnf.


S_DU166C_BAD_LOC_STAT


 Parameters:
	%0c - logical name of the location (from iilocations.lname)
	%1d - value of location status (from iilocations.status)

 Explanation:
	The status field indicates the type of location (DATA, WORK, CKP, etc).
	Some of the bits that are not used have been set.  This means that the
	entire status for the location may be invalid, and the user should
	use accessdb to look at the location and ensure that it is defined
	correctly.

	verifydb will clear unused bits (to avoid confusing accessdb), but this
	does not ensure that the location status is correct.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then the user must give Yes/No
	permission before verifydb can take corrective action.


S_DU166D_NOSUCH_DB


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name (from iiextend.dname)
	%1c - location name (from iiextend.lname)

 Explanation:
	There is a tuple in iiextend for each location of each database in
	the installation.  If the database resides in only the default
	location, there will be only one entry.  If the database has been
	extended to three locations, there will be 4 entries (one for the
	default location, and one for each of the three extended locations).
	Each entry consists of a database name and a location name.  The
	location name must also be in iilocations to be meaningful.  The
	database name must be in iidatabase to be meaningful.

	Each location in iiextend for a database also resides in the database
	configuration file (in the database's default location.)  The config
	file is what the server uses to find extended locations, but table
	iiextend is what accessdb uses to define/display them.  Also, the
	server uses the entry for the default location from iidatabase.dbdev
	to find the config file.  This table must be in sync with the
	config file and with table iidatabase.

	In this case, the database name is not in iidatabase, or has been
	dropped by verifydb.


 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the user must give Yes/No permission before
	verifydb can take corrective action.

	After verifydb has taken corrective action, the user should run accessdb
	to ensure the database is defined correctly.


S_DU166E_NOSUCH_LOC


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name (from iiextend.dname)
	%1c - location name (from iiextend.lname)

 Explanation:
	There is a tuple in iiextend for each location of each database in
	the installation.  If the database resides in only the default
	location, there will be only one entry.  If the database has been
	extended to three locations, there will be 4 entries (one for the
	default location, and one for each of the three extended locations).
	Each entry consists of a database name and a location name.  The
	location name must also be in iilocations to be meaningful.  The
	database name must be in iidatabase to be meaningful.

	Each location in iiextend for a database also resides in the database
	configuration file (in the database's default location.)  The config
	file is what the server uses to find extended locations, but table
	iiextend is what accessdb uses to define/display them.  Also, the
	server uses the entry for the default location from iidatabase.dbdev
	to find the config file.  This table must be in sync with the
	config file and with table iidatabase.

	In this case, the location name is not in iilocations, or has been
	dropped by verifydb.


 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the user must give Yes/No permission before
	verifydb can take corrective action.

	After verifydb has taken corrective action, the user should run accessdb
	to ensure the database is defined correctly.


S_DU166F_NONUNIQUE_SYNONYM


 Parameters:
	%0c - synonym name (from iisynonym.synonym_name)
	%1c - synonym owner (from iisynonym.synonym_owner)

 Explanation:
	The synonym name, owner name pair must be a unique identifier that
	is an alias to a table, index, or view name.  In this case, it is not
	a unique identifier, because there is a table, index, or view with the
	same name and same owner.

	verifydb will recommend dropping the tuple from the iisynonym catalog
	if this condition is encountered.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the user must give Yes/No permission before
	verifydb can take corrective action.


S_DU1670_INVALID_SYNONYM


 Parameters:
	%0c - synonym name (from iisynonym.synonym_name)
	%1c - synonym owner (from iisynonym.synonym_owner)
	%2d - table base ID (from iisynonym.syntabbase)
	%3d - table index ID (from iisynonym.syntabindex)

 Explanation:
	There was not an entry in iirelation for a table with reltid=syntabbase
	and reltidx=syntabindex.  This means that the synonym resolves to a
	nonexistent table.

	verifydb will recommend dropping the tuple from the iisynonym catalog
	if this condition is encountered.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the user must give Yes/No permission before
	verifydb can take corrective action.


S_DU1671_NOT_INDEX


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - table owner

 Explanation:
	The iirelation.relstat bit, TCB_INDEX, was set, but iirelation.reltidx
	was zero. iirelation.reltidx is always nonzero for secondary indexes,
	so this must not really be a secondary index.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the user must give Yes/No permission before
	verifydb can take corrective action.  Otherwise, no action is required.


S_DU1672_MISSING_IIINDEX


 Parameters:
	%0c - secondary index name
	%1c - secondary index owner

 Explanation:
	All secondary indexes need to be entered in iiindex. Since this tuple
	is not in iiindex, this secondary index should be dropped.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	If in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, the user must give Yes/No permission before
	verifydb can take corrective action.  Otherwise, no action is required.


S_DU1673_NO_RULES_RELSTAT


 Parameters:
	%0s - table name (from iirelation.relid)
	%1s - table owner (from iirelation.relowner)

 Explanation:
	verifydb test #38 found the iirelation tuple for the iitree entry did
	not indicate that this table has rules defined on it.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	Unless verifydb is being run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, correction of
	setting PRTUPS bit in iirelation.relstat is automatically performed.
	Otherwise, the user must give yes/no permission to make this correction
	when the prompt is given.

	No correction can be made if verifydb is in REPORT mode. (See DU031E.)


S_DU1674_QRYTEXT_RULE_MISSING


 Parameters:
	%0d - low portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid1)
	%1d - high portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid2)

 Explanation:
	A verifydb test was unable to find the rule definition in 
	iirule that corresponds to this rule querytext. This is an
	informational message only, since the DBMS server does not act
	on iiqrytext.  

	However, the user may want to redefine the rule to the database.  
	It is possible that the table the rule is for does not exist in 
	the database, but verifydb is not able to determine this, as iiqrytext 
	does not have the equivalent of reltid and reltidx.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU1675_QRYTEXT_EVENT_MISSING


 Parameters:
	%0d - low portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid1)
	%1d - high portion of query ID (from iiqrytext.txtid2)

 Explanation:
	verifydb was unable to find the dbevent definition in 
	iievent that corresponds to this dbevent querytext. This is 
	an informational message only, since the DBMS server does not
	act on iiqrytext.  

	However, the user may want to redefine the dbevent to the database.  

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU1676_NOSUCH_DDB


 Parameters:
	%0c - distributed database name (from iistar_cdbs.ddb_name)

 Explanation:
	Table iistar_cdbs is used to specify a distributed database to its
	coordinator database.  In this case, the specified distributed database
	does not exist in this installation.

	verifydb will automatically remove the entry from iistar_cdbs, unless
	it is being run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then the user must give Yes/No
	permission before verifydb can take corrective action.

	%0c - distributed database name (from iistar_cdbs.ddb_name)
	%1c - distributed database owner (as per iidatabase)
	%2c - distributed database owner (as per iistar_cdbs)

 Explanation:
	Table iistar_cdbs is used to specify a distributed database to its
	coordinator database.  In this case, the DBA of the distributed
	database in iistar_cdbs does not agree with the DBA name from the
	iidatabase entry.

	Unless it is being run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, verifydb will
	automatically replace the erroneous value in iistar_cdbs with the
	value from iidatabase,

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then the user must give Yes/No
	permission before verifydb can take corrective action.


S_DU1679_WRONG_CDB_OWNER


 Parameters:
	%0c - coordinator database name (from iistar_cdbs.ddb_name)
	%1c - coordinator database owner (as per iidatabase)
	%2c - coordinator database owner (as per iistar_cdbs)

 Explanation:
	Table iistar_cdbs is used to specify a distributed database to its
	coordinator database.  In this case, the DBA of the coordinator
	database in iistar_cdbs does not agree with the DBA name from the

	coordinator database.  In this case, the unique ID for the coordinator
	database in iistar_cdbs does not agree with the unique ID from the
	iidatabase entry.

	Unless it is being run in RUNINTERACTIVE mode, verifydb will
	automatically replace the erroneous value in iistar_cdbs with the
	with the value from iidatabase.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then the user must give Yes/No
	permission before verifydb can take corrective action.


S_DU167B_NO_IISTARCDBS_ENTRY


 Parameters:
	%0c - coordinator database unique identifier (from iicdbid_idx)

 Explanation:
	Table iistar_cdbs has a secondary index, iicdbid_idx, on cdb_id.
	The value of cdb_id in the secondary index does not correspond to any
	tuples in base table iistar_cdbs.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None, unless in RUNINTERACTIVE mode.  Then the user must give Yes/No
	permission before verifydb can take corrective action.

	Otherwise, no action is required.
 

S_DU1702_EXPIRED_TABLE_FOUND


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - table owner

 Explanation:
	verifydb found an expired relation while purging a database.

 System Status:
	verifydb will automatically purge this table in PURGE or EXPIRED_PURGE
	operation unless the mode restricts this.  The REPORT mode does not
	permit destruction of this table; RUNINTERACTIVE mode requires user
	permission to drop this expired table.

	but to discontinue execution.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU1705_AFLAG_WARNING


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A flag was specified that is meaningless in the OPERATION context;
	it will be ignored.

 System Status:
	verifydb will ignore this invalid parameter and continue execution.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU1706_NOT_STARDB


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	The verifydb REFRESH_LDBS operation is only to be performed on
	distributed databases.  This operation has been specified on a non-
	Star database, and that database will be skipped.

	If the user has specified the INSTALLATION or DBA scopes, they should
	expect to see this warning, indicating that non-Star databases have been
	skipped for an operation that works only on Star (or distributed)
	databases.  If the DBNAME scope is specified and the user gets this
	warning, it indicates a user error where they specified the name of
	a database that they believed to be a Star (distributed) database, but
	it was not.

 System Status:
	verifydb will continue searching the scope list for other databases
	to operate on.  If this was the only database in the scope list, then
	verifydb will terminate.

 Recommendation:
	If the user has specified the DBNAME scope, then the user must re-run
	verifydb with the correct Star database name(s).


S_DU1707_LCL_CAP_UNKNOWN


 Parameters:
	%0c - capability name
	%1c - database name
	%2c - node name

 Explanation:
	The verifydb REFRESH_LDBS operation could not determine the value of
	the specified capability, so it could not update iiddb_ldb_dbcaps.

 System Status:
	verifydb will skip this capability but will continue on to the next
	database.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU1708_LCL_CAP_MISSING


 Parameters:
	%0c - capability name
	%1c - value of capability from local database
	%2c - database name
	%3c - node name

 Explanation:
	The verifydb REFRESH_LDBS operation found a capability that is defined
	in the local database but was not in iiddb_ldb_dbcaps.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU1709_LCL_CAP_DIFFERENT


 Parameters:
	%0c - capability name
	%1c - value of capability (from local database)
	%2c - database name
	%3c - node name
	%4c - value of capability (from iiddb_ldb_dbcaps)

 Explanation:
	The verifydb REFRESH_LDBS operation found a capability that is defined
	at one value in the local database but has a different value in
	iiddb_ldb_dbcaps.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU1710_2NDARY_INDEX


 Parameters:
	%0c - secondary index name
	%1c - secondary index owner

 Explanation:
	verifydb's patch operation (XTABLE OR TABLE) will patch the disk file
	associated with a table.  That patch operation may result in some/all
	tuples being dropped from the table.  The patch operation operates only
	on the base table.  If it changes the base table, then the strict
	correlation between the secondary index and base table is lost.
	Therefore, verifydb must drop all secondary indexes before operating
	on the base table.

 System Status:
	This is an informational message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU1711_UNIQUE_CONSTRAINT


S_DU1712_CHECK_CONSTRAINT

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU1752_LABEL_ALL_USED


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	This is an advisory message, indicates all short security labels
	are in use so no purge will be performed.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU1753_LABEL_PURGING


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	This is an advisory message, indicates unused short security labels
	are being deleted from the database.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU1754_LABEL_UNREF


 Parameters:
	%0 - number of labels
	%1 - database name

 Explanation:
	This is an advisory message, indicates that unreferenced short security
	labels were found in the indicated database. In RUNINTERACTIVE mode,
	this may be followed by a prompt requesting whether to purge or not.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU1755_LABEL_ROW_CNT


 Parameters:
	%0 - number of deleted labels
	%1 - prior number deleted

 Explanation:
	This is a debugging message indicating the number of rows deleted
	while processing the current table/column.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	None.


S_DU17FC_TABLE_PATCH_WARNING


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is a legal disclaimer that should be printed every time
	the TABLE or XTABLE operation is specified.  If the user has selected
	the RUNINTERACTIVE mode, this will be followed by a prompt asking the
	user if they want to continue or abort.

 System Status:
	This is a warning message, not an error.  Unless the user specifies
	that they want to stop the process, verifydb continues processing.

 Recommendation:
	No user action is possible unless the RUNINTERACTIVE mode has been
	specified.  If that mode is specified, the user must respond to the
	"Do you want to continue?" prompt with either "Y" or "N".


S_DU17FD_CATALOG_PATCH_WARNING


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is a legal disclaimer that should be printed every time
	the  DBMS_CATALOGS operation is specified.  If the user has selected
	the RUNINTERACTIVE mode, this will be followed by a prompt asking
	the user if they want to continue or abort.

 System Status:
	This is a warning message, not an error.  Unless the user specifies
	that they want to stop the process, verifydb continues processing.

 Recommendation:
	If the user has not selected RUNINTERACTIVE mode, no damage will be
	done to the database, and no interaction is required.  If the user
	has specified the RUNINTERACTIVE mode, then the user must answer a
	prompt asking whether or not they really want to run verifydb.
	If the user has not already backed up their database, they should
	probably answer "NO" to the prompt, then back up the database.  They
	can then run verifydb.

	If the user was running with checkpoints and journaling, it may be
	better to roll back to the last checkpoint and recover their database
	via journaling.  The verifydb patch option should not be used if the
	user can recover via journaling.


S_DU17FE_FORCE_CONSISTENT_WARN


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The message is a legal disclaimer that the DBMS server cannot ensure
	the database will stay consistent after it has been marked inconsistent
	and then forced consistent by verifydb.  If the user continues using
	this database after forcing it consistent, it is possible that the new
	work done may be lost at some future date.

 System Status:
	This is a warning message, not an error.  Unless the user specifies
	that they want to stop the process, verifydb keeps processing.

 Recommendation:
	If the user has not selected RUNINTERACTIVE mode, verifydb will just
	print the warning message and continue its processing.  If the user
	has specified the RUNINTERACTIVE mode, then the user must answer a
	prompt asking whether or not they really want to run verifydb.

	If the user has journaling enabled, they may prefer to roll back to
	the last checkpoint and then use journaling to recapture the work
	they have done since that checkpoint.  If they do not have journaling
	enabled, then they probably do want to force the database consistent.

	However, once the database has been forced consistent, it should not
	be used as though it had never been marked inconsistent.  The
	user is expected to use unloaddb to get their data out of this
	database.  They are expected to destroy this database and recreate it,
	then run the reload.ing script that unloaddb creates.  If they keep
	using the database they have forced consistent, they may run into
	future problems.


S_DU17FF_FIX_INTERACTIVELY


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The fix for this verifydb test may only be performed in RUNINTERACTIVE
	mode if the user gives Yes permission when prompted for it.  Since the
	current mode is not RUNINTERACTIVE, no corrective active may be taken.

	This message is displayed in lieu of a prompt (by duve_talk()) whenever
	the message type is INTERACTIVE (permit fix only in interactive mode),
	and the mode is not RUNINTERACTIVE. This message will not be displayed
	if the mode is REPORT.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user may opt to manually take corrective action or to rerun verifydb
	in the RUNINTERACTIVE mode.

	caused when upgradedb is invoked on a Star database when there
	is no Star server running.

 System Status:
	Warning message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Bring up a Star server, then run upgradefe as follows:
	"upgradefe <dbname>/star -f <client list>".


W_DU1865_MISSING_UTEXE_DEF


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	File ii_config:utexe.def does not have an entry for upgradefe;
	therefore, the upgradefe spawn failed.

 System Status:
	Warning message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Add an entry, then run upgradefe or re-run upgradedb.


W_DU1866_BAD_UTEXE_DEF


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	File ii_config:utexe.def has an incorrect entry for upgradefe;
	therefore, the upgradefe spawn failed.

 System Status:
	Warning message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the entry, then run upgradefe or re-run upgradedb.


W_DU1867_UGRADEFE_FAIL


 Parameters:
	%0d - status of upgradefe spawn

 Explanation:
	The upgradefe spawn failed with the specified status.

 System Status:
	Warning message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Try running upgradefe directly.


W_DU1868_DESTROYED_DB


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	upgradedb cached information about databases in the installation.
	After it cached this information, this database was destroyed,
	so upgradedb cannot operate on it.

 System Status:
	Warning message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user should determine if the database should have been destroyed or
	updated.  If it should not have been destroyed, then restore the
	database from a backup tape, run finddbs, then upgrade the database.


W_DU1869_NOMODIFY


 Parameters:
	%0c - system catalog name
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
	upgradedb tried to modify a system catalog back to its storage
	structure, probably after repopulating it.  The server returned
	an SQL error on the modify.

 System Status:
	Warning message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user should determine why the modify failed.  When the cause has
	been found and fixed, run sysmod on the database.


W_DU186A_MISSING_SYSCAT


 Parameters:
	%0c - system catalog name
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
	upgradedb couldn't find a system catalog that it wanted to upgrade
	to 6.5 status.  So, this catalog will be empty in 6.5, because it
	wasn't there in 6.4 to copy from.

 System Status:
	Warning message; processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user should determine what happened to the missing system catalog.
	The user may have to add the missing tuples to the 6.5 catalog.

	GRANT OPTION on catalogs that are base tables or SQL views.

 System Status:
	Execution stops.

 Recommendation:
	Examine the error log; contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_DU2100_BAD_RECONNECT

 E_DU2100_BAD_RECONNECT
 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Some utilities (createdb, upgradedb) need to spawn upgradefe while
	connected to a Star server if they are attempting to operate (i.e.,
	create or upgrade) a distributed database.  They do some work via the
	local server, disconnect from it, then attempt to connect to the Star
	server.  If the connection to the Star server fails, they will attempt
	to reconnect to the local server.  If that also fails, then there is
	probably something that has gone wrong in the installation and
	this message is printed.

 System Status:
	Execution stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should verify that local and Star servers are up and operative
	in their installation.  The user should verify that there are no other
	installation problems that can make it impossible to connect to these
	servers.  If the user is doing a createdb, they must use destroydb to
	destroy what they attempted to create, then re-issue the createdb
	command.  If the user is attempting an upgradedb, they should re-issue
	the command.


E_DU2101_BAD_DISCONNECT

 E_DU2101_BAD_DISCONNECT
 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Some utilities (createdb, upgradedb) need to spawn upgradefe while
	connected to a Star server if they are attempting to operate (i.e.,
	create or upgrade) a distributed database.  They do some work via the
	local server, disconnect from it, then connect to the Star server and
	spawn upgradefe.  After upgradefe completes, the utility attempts to
	disconnect from the Star server and reconnect to the local server.  In
	this instance, the utility received an error while attempting to
	disconnect from the Star server or reconnect to the local server.

 System Status:
	Execution stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should verify that local and Star servers are up and operative
	in their installation.  The user should verify that there are no other
	installation problems that can make it impossible to connect to these
	servers.  If the user is doing a createdb, they must use destroydb to
	destroy what they attempted to create, then re-issue the createdb
	command.  If the user is attempting an upgradedb, they should re-issue
	the command.


E_DU2102_BAD_STARDISCONNECT

 E_DU2102_BAD_STARDISCONNECT
 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Some utilities (createdb, upgradedb) need to spawn upgradefe while
	connected to a Star server if they are attempting to operate (i.e.,
	create or upgrade) a distributed database.  They connect to a Star
	server to do so, and when the upgradefe has completed, the utility
	disconnects from the Star server and reconnects to the local server.
	However, the utility received an error when attempting to disconnect
	from the Star server.

 System Status:
	Execution stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should verify that local and Star servers are up and operative
	in their installation.  The user should verify that there are no other
	installation problems that can make it impossible to connect to these
	servers.  If the user is doing a createdb, they must use destroydb to
	destroy what they attempted to create, then re-issue the createdb
	command.  If the user is attempting an upgradedb, they should re-issue
	the command.


E_DU2103_BAD_COMMIT

 E_DU2103_BAD_COMMIT
 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Some utilities (createdb, upgradedb) need to spawn upgradefe while
	connected to a Star server if they are attempting to operate (i.e.,
	create or upgrade) a distributed database.  They first attempt to
	close the transaction they are in, then close the local database
	association and attempt to connect to a Star server.  However, in
	this case, the utility received an error while attempting to commit
	the transaction.

 System Status:
	Execution stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should verify that local and Star servers are up and operative
	in their installation.  The user should verify that there are no other
	installation problems that can make it impossible to connect to these
	servers.  If the user is doing a createdb, they must use destroydb to
	destroy what they attempted to create, then re-issue the createdb
	command.  If the user is attempting an upgradedb, they should re-issue
	the command.


E_DU2104_BAD_LOCALCONNECT

 E_DU2104_BAD_LOCALCONNECT
 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Some utilities (createdb, upgradedb) need to spawn upgradefe while
	connected to a Star server if they are attempting to operate (i.e.,
	create or upgrade) a distributed database.  They do some work via the
	local server, disconnect from it, then connect to the Star server and
	spawn upgradefe.  After upgradefe completes, the utility attempts to
	disconnect from the Star server and reconnect to the local server.  In
	this instance, the utility received an error while attempting to
	reconnect to the local server.

 System Status:
	Execution stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should verify that local and Star servers are up and operative
	in their installation.  The user should verify that there are no other
	installation problems that can make it impossible to connect to these
	servers.  If the user is doing a createdb, they must use destroydb to
	destroy what they attempted to create, then re-issue the createdb
	command.  If the user is attempting an upgradedb, they should re-issue
	the command.


E_DU2105_BAD_LOCALDISCONNECT

 E_DU2101_BAD_DISCONNECT
 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Some utilities (createdb, upgradedb) need to spawn upgradefe while
	connected to a Star server if they are attempting to operate (i.e.,
	create or upgrade) a distributed database.  They do some work via the
	local server, disconnect from it, then connect to the Star server and
	spawn upgradefe.  After upgradefe completes, the utility attempts to
	disconnect from the Star server and reconnect to the local server.  In
	this instance, the utility received an error while attempting to
	disconnect from the local server.

 System Status:
	Execution stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should verify that local and Star servers are up and operative
	in their installation.  The user should verify that there are no other
	installation problems that can make it impossible to connect to these
	servers.  If the user is doing a createdb, they must use destroydb to
	destroy what they attempted to create, then re-issue the createdb
	command.  If the user is attempting an upgradedb, they should re-issue
	the command.


E_DU2106_UNOPENED_DB

 E_DU2106_UNOPENED_DB
 Parameters:
	%0c - coordinator database name

 Explanation:
	Some utilities (createdb, upgradedb) need to spawn upgradefe while
	connected to a Star server if they are attempting to operate (i.e.,
	create or upgrade) a distributed database.  They do some work via the
	local server, disconnect from it, then connect to the Star server and
	spawn upgradefe.  After upgradefe completes, the utility attempts to
	disconnect from the Star server and reconnect to the local server.  In
	this instance, the upgradedb utility should have been connected to the
	coordinator database via a local server and was not.

 System Status:
	Execution stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should verify that the local and Star servers are up and
	operative in their installation.  The user should verify that there
	are no other installation problems that can make it impossible to
	connect and do commits via these servers, then re-issue the upgradedb
	command.


E_DU2410_GEN_CL_FAIL


E_DU2411_BAD_LOINGPATH


E_DU2412_CANT_TRANSLATE_LOC


E_DU2414_BAD_CASE_LABEL


E_DU2415_BAD_DMP_DIR


E_DU2416_NOCOPY_SYSCAT


 Parameters:
	%0c - system catalog name
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
 	6.5 upgradedb copies system catalogs to temporary tables
	to implement alter table.  If this fails, there's no point in
	trying to continue.  Probably the disk lacks sufficient
	free space.

 System Status:
	Execution stops; the database is not upgraded.

 Recommendation:
	Verify that the II_DATABASE location has sufficient free disk space.


E_DU2417_NODROP_SYSCAT


 Parameters:
	%0c - system catalog name
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
 	After 6.5 upgradedb copies system catalogs to temporary tables,
	it drops the original table to implement alter table.  If this
	fails, there's no point in trying to continue.

 System Status:
	Execution stops; the database is not upgraded.

 Recommendation:
	Verify that upgradedb is run with required privileges.


E_DU2418_NOCREATE_SYSCAT


 Parameters:
	%0c - system catalog name
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
 	After 6.5 upgradedb copies system catalogs to temporary tables
	and drops the original table, it creates the original table
	with the new 6.5 definition.  If this fails, incorrect privileges
	are the most likely cause.

 System Status:
	Execution stops; the database is not upgraded.

 Recommendation:
	Verify that upgradedb is run with the required privileges.


E_DU2419_NOREPOP_SYSCAT


 Parameters:
	%0c - system catalog name
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
 	After 6.5 upgradedb copies system catalogs to temporary tables,
	drops the original table, and creates the original table
	with the new 6.5 definition, it copies the data back from
	the temporary table.  If this fails, free disk space is
	the most likely cause.

 System Status:
	Execution stops; the database is not upgraded.

 Recommendation:
	Verify that the II_DATABASE location has sufficient free disk space.


E_DU241A_SYSCAT_UPGRADE_FAILED


E_DU241B_NODROP_TEMP


 Parameters:
	%0c - system catalog name
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
 	When 6.5 upgradedb copies system catalogs to temporary tables,
	it first checks to see if the temporary table is already
	there.  If so, it drops it.  If this fails, something is
	very wrong, and upgradedb cannot proceed.

 System Status:
	Execution stops; the database is not upgraded.

 Recommendation:
	Verify that the user has sufficient privileges.


E_DU2F00_TOO_MANY_ARGS


E_DU3000_BAD_USRNAME


E_DU3001_USER_NOT_KNOWN


E_DU3002_ALIAS_NOT_KNOWN


E_DU3003_NOT_SUPER_USER


E_DU3004_NO_ALIAS_FLAG


E_DU3005_NOT_AUTHORIZED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	SECURITY and/or OPERATOR privilege is required to run this
	utility. The user running it does not have sufficient privileges.

 System Status:
	Execution stops.

 Recommendation:
	Have the system administrator (or other user with sufficient 
	privileges) to either: a) use accessdb to give this user
	more privileges; or b) run this utility for them.


E_DU3006_CANT_OPEN_IIDBDB


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	finddbs failed while attempting to connect to the iidbdb.  This can
	be indicative of a serious installation problem, but that is not
	necessarily the case.  If someone is running a fast-commit server that
	is accessing the iidbdb and you are using anther server, you can
	get locked out.  Also, if someone is accessing the iidbdb with the
	"+U" flag, you will be locked out.

 System Status:
	Execution stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user must determine if the installation is unhealthy or if the
	iidbdb is locked or simply in use by a different fast-commit server.
	The user must fix the installation problems, if any exist.  Then the
	user should re-issue the finddbs command.


E_DU3010_BAD_DBNAME


E_DU3011_NOT_DBA_DS


E_DU3012_NODS_DBDB_DS


E_DU3014_NO_DBNAME


E_DU3015_CANT_DESTROY_50DB


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - database owner

 Explanation:
	If the 5.0 dbdb is converted to iidbdb or if "finddbs -r" is run
	in an installation that contains both 5.0 and 6.x databases, there
	will be entries for 5.0 databases in the iidatabase catalog.  These
	entries will have the DU_CONVERTING bit set in iidatabase.access.

	destroydb will destroy databases if it can find entries for them in
	iidatabase and iiextend.  It removes any entries that exist from
	the iidbdb, then destroys the directories associated with the database.
	This means that it would be possible to destroy 5.0 databases from
	release 6.0.  That would leave the 5.0 catalogs indicating the
	database exists, but the directories would be missing.  Therefore,
	destroydb refuses to destroy databases that are marked as DU_CONVERTING,
	unless the "-p" option is selected and the user gives permission.

 System Status:
	destroydb prints a warning and refuses to destroy the database. This
	message is presented when the "-p" flag is not specified.

 Recommendation:
	If this is a healthy 5.0 database, the user has two choices:

	  1.  use 5.0 destroydb
	  2.  do not destroy the database

	If this is the obscure case of a conversion that failed and the
	database is no longer accessible by 5.x, the user must use the "-p"
	(prompt) option.


E_DU3016_50_DB_FOUND


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - database owner

 Explanation:
	If the 5.0 dbdb is converted to iidbdb or if "finddbs -r" is run
	in an installation that contains both 5.0 and 6.x databases, there
	will be entries for 5.0 databases in the iidatabase catalog.  These
	entries will have the DU_CONVERTING bit set in iidatabase.access.

	destroydb will destroy databases if it can find entries for them in
	iidatabase and iiextend.  It removes any entries that exist from
	the iidbdb, then destroys the directories associated with the database.
	This means that it would be possible to destroy 5.0 databases from
	release 6.0.  That would leave the 5.0 catalogs indicating the
	database exists, but the directories would be missing.  Therefore,
	destroydb refuses to destroy databases that are marked as DU_CONVERTING,
	unless the "-p" option is selected and the user gives permission.

 System Status:
	destroydb prints a warning.  It will prompt the user for permission
	to destroy this database, and will do so if permission is given.  This
	could have undesirable effects on the 5.0 installation if the user
	did not really mean to destroy the database.

 Recommendation:
	The user must determine whether or not this database is known to the 5.0
	installation. If this database is known to the 5.0 installation, then
	they should use 5.0 destroydb first, then reissue the 6.x destroydb
	command to clean up the 6.0 catalogs.


E_DU3020_DB_NOT_FOUND


E_DU3021_DB_EXISTS_CR


E_DU3022_DB_UNIQUE_CR


 Parameters:
	%0c - non-unique characters

 Explanation:
	Current limitations require all database names be unique in
	first 24 characters.


 System Status:
	Database creation terminates.

 Recommendation:
	The user must choose a name which is unique in first 24 characters.

E_DU3044_NO_DMPLOC


 Parameters:
	%0c - dump location name

 Explanation:
	The online dump location did not exist in the iilocations
	catalog.  This message is issued by convto60.

 System Status:
	convto60 abnormally terminates.

 Recommendation:
	Call Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

E_DU3140_DBDB_NOT_SUPERUSER_CR


E_DU314A_CONFIG_TOO_BIG_CR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A database utility, such as createdb or convto60, could not create
	the specified file.  If failure is due to a lack of disk space or
	permissions, a CL error message should be in the error log.  Another
	possibility would be if there are extraneous files or multiple versions
	of valid files in the database template directory.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Consult your system administrator to ensure that the 
	installation is set up correctly.

E_DU3180_BAD_TEMPLATE_COPY


E_DU3190_BAD_LKINIT


 Parameters:
	%0x - value returned by call to LKinitialize()

 Explanation:
	destroydb could not connect to the locking system. Connection to 
	the locking system may be rejected if destroydb is not installed 
	(or run) with the proper privilege, or the lack of a critical 
	system resource prevents destroydb from successful operation.  
	For example, the former condition will occur on VMS if destroydb 
	isn't installed with CMKRNL and on Unix if destroydb isn't setuid 
	to the installation owner.  The latter condition can occur on Unix 
	if the swap space available is insufficient to allow destroydb 
	to map the shared memory segment used for locking.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Consult your system administrator to ensure the installation
	and system are configured correctly.

E_DU3511_NOCR_FE_CATS



 Explanation:
	    CREATEDB just tried to call "upgradefe" to create the front-end system
	    catalogs. Upgradefe was not able to successfully create the
	    front-end catalogs.


 System Status:
	    The new database will not be usable.


 Recommendation:
	    Check for problems in your environment and DBMS installation
	    (disk space, subprocess and other quotas, is the installation
	    complete with executables present in the "bin" subdirectory, etc.).
	    VMS users can run the "checkenv" utility.


E_DU3512_BAD_CLIENT_NM



 Explanation:
	The special client name 'nofeclients' appeared on the
	command line along with some other client name(s). When
	'nofeclients' is specified, no other dictionary client
	names can appear. The presence of the dictionary client
	name 'nofeclients' tells CREATEDB to not create
	any front-end catalogs in the new database.


 System Status:
	    CREATEDB exits and the database is not created.


 Recommendation:
	Check the dictionary client names you specified on the CREATEDB
	command line. Dictionary client names should follow the database name
	at the end of the command line.


E_DU3513_NO_WRITE_ACCESS



 Explanation:
	Createdb or Sysmod just checked for write access for creating
	temporary files, and found it cannot create files. It exited
	after performing no work.


 System Status:
	Createdb or Sysmod will exit. The database is not affected
	(it is as if Createdb or Sysmod were never run).


 Recommendation:
	Check why files cannot be created in your current working directory
	or (optionally) in II_TEMPORARY. When you can create files, run
	Createdb or Sysmod again.


E_DU3514_EMPTY_CLIENT_LIST



 Explanation:
	Createdb or Sysmod just found a -f flag on the command line
	with no client name following the -f.


 System Status:
	Createdb or Sysmod will exit. The database is not affected
	(it is as if Createdb or Sysmod were never run).


 Recommendation:
	Specify a front-end dictionary client name(s) following the -f flag, 
	or else do not specify the -f flag.


E_DU3515_CLIENT_NM_CONFLICT


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	"nofeclients" is a special client name indicating that all FE catalog
	operations are to be bypassed.  It is illegal to use this in conjunction
	with other client names.

 System Status:
	Processing is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Check the dictionary client names you specified on the command line.
	Dictionary client names should follow the database name at the end of
	the command line.


E_DU3516_DBDB_NOSECURITY


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Creating the database database (iidbdb) is a privileged operation.
	Only users with SECURITY privilege can do this.

 System Status:
	Processing is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the user trying to create the iidbdb has SECURITY
	privilege, then try again.


E_DU3519_LEGAL_REG_DELIM_ID


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	If conflicting values were picked up from the command line
	and/or installation defaults, it's helpful to explain which
	value came from where.  Since the user can see the command
	line, don't bother explaining that.  Instead, createdb displays
	this message to point out values that were picked up from the
	installation defaults.

 System Status:
	createdb aborts; the database is not created.

 Recommendation:
	Check the createdb command-line switches and/or configuration settings.


E_DU351A_MULTI_DB_DESTRY


 Parameters:
      none

 Explanation:
      Destroydb can only destroy one database at a time.

 System Status:
      destroydb  exits and no databases are destroyed.

 Recommendation:
      Specify only one database on the command line.


E_DU351B_INCOMPATIBLE_VERSION


 Parameters:
	Frontend (createdb) Ingres version
	DBMS Ingres version

 Explanation:
	For architectural reasons createdb cannot run between incompatible
	versions of ingres, for most purposes the major release ID must be
	the same.

 System Status:
	Createdb exits, no database is created

 Recommendation:
	Run createdb on the remote node, or on a compatible version of Ingres.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_DU5007_SPECIFY_ALL_FLAGS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	verifydb must be evoked with the "-m", "-s", and "-o" flags.
	Defaults are not permitted.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	Re-enter the verifydb command with the correct parameters.


E_DU5008_SPECIFY_TABLE_NAME


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	When the table operation is selected, verifydb must be informed of
	the name of the table to operate on.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	Re-enter the verifydb command with the correct parameters.


E_DU5009_SPECIFY_DB_NAME


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	When the dbname scope is selected, verifydb must be informed of
	the name(s) of the database(s) to operate on.  The user may specify
	from 1 to MAX_NAMES (in duvdb.h) databases.  If more are specified,
	all database names in the list that exceed the limit are ignored.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	Re-enter the verifydb command with the correct parameters.


E_DU5010_NO_SYSCAT_FILE


 Parameters:
	%0c - system catalog name (from iirelation.relid)

 Explanation:
	A disk file for one of the system catalogs cannot be found.  This
	means that verifydb will not be able to perform all of its checks
	on system catalogs.

 System Status:
	verifydb will keep running as long as it can -- the length of time
	depends on which system catalog is missing.  When it cannot continue
	any longer, it will take an exception exit.

 Recommendation:
	Try to get a backup of the missing system catalog file.


E_DU501A_CANT_CONNECT


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	Unable to connect to the specified database (specified on the command
	line with the "-t" flag).

 System Status:
	verifydb could not connect to the database specified by the user.

 Recommendation:
	Re-run the verifydb utility, but specify a valid database name.


E_DU501B_CANT_CONNECT_AS_USER


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - user name

 Explanation:
	verifydb is unable to connect to the specified database (specified
	on the command line with the "-t" flag) as the specified user
	(specified on the command line with the "-u" flag).

 System Status:
	verifydb could not connect to the database specified by the user.

 Recommendation:
	Re-run the verifydb utility, but specify a valid database name and/or
	a valid user.


E_DU501C_EMPTY_IIRELATON


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Table iirelation is a core DBMS catalog. Without it, it is not possible
	to access the data in the database.  This is a very severe error.

 System Status:
	verifydb will stop processing, as it is not possible to act on this
	database.

 Recommendation:
	The user should attempt to recover the contents of the iirelation file
	using the rollforwarddb utility (or the contents of a backup tape for
	file aaaaaaab.t01 for location ii_database, if the database was not 
	checkpointed).


E_DU501D_SCOPE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Not all of the verifydb features are implemented yet.  The only
	scope feature implemented at this time is dbname.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should reissue the verifydb command using only -sdbname scope.


E_DU501E_OP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Not all of the verifydb features are implemented yet.  The operation
	the user selected is not yet implemented.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should reissue the verifydb command using an implemented 
	operation.


E_DU501F_CATALOG_CHECK_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	verifydb was not able to check/patch the system catalogs completely.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should attempt to use rollforwarddb from the checkpoint to
	recover the database.


E_DU5020_DB_PATCH_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	verifydb was not able to patch the database consistent.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should attempt to use rollforwarddb from the checkpoint to
	recover the database.


E_DU5021_EMPTY_IITREE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Table iitree is a core DBMS catalog that describes view definitions for
	the standard catalogs.  If it is empty, then the standard catalogs
	are corrupted.  This is a very severe error.

 System Status:
	verifydb will stop processing, as it is not reasonable to act on this
	database.

 Recommendation:
	The user should attempt to recover the contents of the iitree file
	using the rollforwarddb utility.


E_DU5022_EMPTY_IIDBDEPENDS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Table iidbdepends is a QP DBMS catalog that describes view definitions
	for the standard catalogs.  If it is empty, then the standard catalogs
	are corrupted.  This is a very severe error.

 System Status:
	verifydb will stop processing, as it is not reasonable to act on this
	database.

 Recommendation:
	The user should attempt to recover the contents of the iidbdepends file
	using the rollforwarddb utility.


E_DU5023_CANT_OPEN_LOG_FILE


 Parameters:
	%0c - the full path to the log file.

 Explanation:
	verifydb was not able to open the verifydb log file in the II_CONFIG 
	directory. This was either because verifydb detected that the path to 
	the log file does not exist, or the user does not have write permssions 
	to the log file. 

 System Status:
	verifydb considers it a warning if it is unable to open the log
	file in the II_CONFIG directory.  In such a case, verifydb will print 
	this warning message and continue logging to the screen.
	verifydb will not print this error if the "-n" flag is used.

 Recommendation:
	Check the file path is correct and that you have write permissions to
	the directory and or the file. 

	You can bypass opening the log file in II_CONFIG by using the "-n" flag. 
	Depending on the operating system, you could then redirect the screen
	output to a file of your choice.


E_DU5024_TBL_DROP_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
	verifydb was not able to delete the table from the system catalogs.  

 System Status:
	The verifydb process terminates.

 Recommendation:
	The best thing to do is to verify that the table really exists,
	because nonexistent tables are usually why verifydb can't drop the
	table.


E_DU5025_NO_SUCH_TABLE


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - table owner

 Explanation:
	The table does not exist in the specified database.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process terminates.

 Recommendation:
	Perhaps the table is owned by another user.  Determine who the
	owner is and run verifydb again, this time using the "-u" flag.


E_DU5026_EMPTY_IIUSER


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Table iiuser defines the users for an installation.  If the table is
	empty, then no one is authorized to run on this installation.
	This is a severe error.

	The iiuser table should be recovered from backup, if possible.

 System Status:
	verifydb will stop processing, as it is not reasonable to act on this
	database.

 Recommendation:
	The user should attempt to recover the contents of the iiuser file.


E_DU5027_CMPTLVL_MISMATCH


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - major compatibility level of verifydb
	%2c - major compatibility level of database

 Explanation:
	You are trying to run the wrong version of verifydb for this database.
	verifydb's minor and major compatibility levels must be greater than or
	equal to the database's level.

 System Status:
	verifydb will stop processing for this database, as it is not
	reasonable to act on this database.

 Recommendation:
	The user should get the correct version of verifydb.  If that is
	not available, call Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

	NOTE TO TECH SUPPORT: Do not manually change levels in iidatabase
	catalog -- if you run an old version of verifydb and the catalogs have
	changed since that version, you will probably destroy the database
	beyond recovery.  Get the right version -- there is no workaround.


E_DU5028_CMPTMINOR_MISMATCH


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1d - minor compatibility level of verifydb
	%2d - minor compatibility level of database

 Explanation:
	You are trying to run the wrong version of verifydb for this database.
	verifydb's minor and major compatibility levels must be greater than or
	equal to the database's level.

 System Status:
	verifydb will stop processing for this database, as it is not
	reasonable to act on this database.

 Recommendation:
	The user should get the correct version of verifydb.  If that is
	not available, call Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

	NOTE TO TECH SUPPORT: Do not manually change levels in iidatabase
	catalog -- if you run an old version of verifydb and the catalogs have
	changed since that version, you will probably destroy the database
	beyond recovery.  Get the right version -- there is no workaround.


E_DU5029_EMPTY_IIDATABASE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Table iidatabase defines the databases for an installation.  If the
	table is empty, there are no databases in the installation, including
	the one we are currently examining. This is a severe error.

 System Status:
	verifydb will stop processing, as it is not reasonable to act on this
	database.

 Recommendation:
	The user should attempt to recover the contents of the iidatabase file.


E_DU502A_PURGE_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	verifydb was not able to purge temporary or expired relations in
	this database.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should attempt to rerun verifydb.


E_DU502B_CANT_MAKE_PURGELIST


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	verifydb was not able to purge temporary or expired relations in
	the database.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	This is probably caused by lack of dynamic memory.  The user should
	increase dynamic memory for this process, then attempt to re-run.


E_DU502C_UNABLE_TO_DELETE_FILE


 Parameters:
	%0c - filename
	%1c - pathname to directory containing file
	%2c - database name
	%3c - location name

 Explanation:
	verifydb was attempting to purge a temporary file.  DIdelete() failed
	to delete this file.

 System Status:
	This is a fatal error -- verifydb processing stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should retry verifydb.  If it still fails, the user should
	start looking at why -- is this a read only directory, is verifydb
	installed, does it have the correct privileges, etc.


E_DU502D_NOFREE_PURGETABLE


 Parameters:
	%0c - lowest temp table name
	%1c - max temp table name

 Explanation:
	verifydb must create a temporary table (owned by $ingres).  The name
	of that table must fall between the lower and upper table names --
	verifydb uses a lookup table of possible names.  In this case, the
	database already had tables owned by $ingres with all of the names that
	verifydb has in its lookup table.

 System Status:
	This is a fatal error -- verifydb processing stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user must free up one of these table names.  If these are temp
	tables, then delete them.  If not, copy one table to something else,
	drop that table, run verifydb, recreate the table, and copy the data
	back.


E_DU502E_TABLE_OP_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
	An error was encountered while attempting the table or xtable
	operation.  That error is reported in the verifydb log.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process stops; the transaction is aborted. But any
	changes to the disk file may or may not be flushed to disk, depending
	on DMF's state when the error was encountered.

 Recommendation:
	The user should refer to the verifydb log file to see what went wrong.
	The user may be required to take some corrective action, based on the
	nature of the error.  Certain errors are forever fatal -- such as
	DMF not being able to open the file.  Other errors may be transient,
	and repeating the verifydb table operation command will often
	succeed.


E_DU502F_CANT_PATCH_SCONDUR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	S_CONCUR (or DBMS core catalogs) must be a hash.  DMF assumes the
	format of the file.  It is illegal to modify the file to any other
	storage format.  Since patch always modifies a table to heap, it
	is not reasonable to patch a core catalog.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process aborts its transaction and terminates.

 Recommendation:
	The user should use normal methods to get healthy core catalogs; 
	i.e., unloaddb and reload or possibly recover from a checkpoint.


E_DU5030_CANT_PATCH_INDEX


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The patch operation may cause individual tuples or groups of tuples
	to be dropped.  It is not reasonable to drop some tuples from a
	secondary index, because corresponding tuples will not be dropped
	from the base table.  Then we will hit a condition where the base
	table and secondary index are out of sync with each other.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process aborts its transaction and terminates.

 Recommendation:
	The user should drop the secondary index and recreate it.


E_DU5031_TABLE_DOESNT_EXIST


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - table owner

 Explanation:
	The target for check table or patch table does not exist.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process aborts its transaction and terminates.

 Recommendation:
	The user should determine the table name and user that owns that
	table.  If the owner is not the user running verifydb, use the "-u"
	flag to specify the table's owner.


E_DU5032_NO_AUTHORITY


 Parameters:
	%0c - user name
	%1c - database name
	%2c - DBA

 Explanation:
	The user running verifydb does not have superuser privilege
	and is not the DBA of the target database. Therefore, access to this
	database is denied.

 System Status:
	verifydb does not grant this user access to this database. If there
	are other databases in the scope, verifydb will go on to attempt to
	process the next database.

 Recommendation:
	The user should either get the DBA or a superuser to run the
	command for them, or they should get the system administrator to make
	them a superuser.


E_DU5033_REPORTMODE_INVALID


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Certain verifydb operations do not have a REPORT mode.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process reports this error and terminates.

 Recommendation:
	The user should reissue the command using one of the RUN modes.


E_DU5034_EXPIRED_SYNTAX_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This syntax error occurred during PURGE_EXPIRED processing.  It is
	probably caused because verifydb encountered an expired table that
	was created in QUEL.  That table name is legal in QUEL, but happens
	to be a reserved word in ESQL.  So the DBMS server gave verifydb an
	error when verifydb attempted to drop this table.

 System Status:
	verifydb reports this error and continues the purge operation as though
	no error had occurred.  However, the table that this error occurred
	on is not purged.

 Recommendation:
	The user should manually destroy this expired table from the database
	using QUEL TM.


E_DU5035_REPORTMODE_ONLY


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The user specified one of the RUN modes in conjunction with the
	ACCESSCHECK operation.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process reports this error and aborts.

 Recommendation:
	The user should reissue the command using REPORT mode.


E_DU5036_NODBS_IN_SCOPE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	verifydb tried to translate the scope to a list of databases. It could
	not find any databases in that scope list.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process reports this error and terminates.

 Recommendation:
	The user should reissue the command using the correct scope and user
	specifications.


E_DU5037_INVALID_ACCESS_USR


 Parameters:
	%0c - user name

 Explanation:
	verifydb tried to translate the scope to a list of databases.  It could
	not find any databases in that scope list.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process reports this error and terminates.

 Recommendation:
	The user should reissue the command using the correct scope and user
	specifications.


E_DU5038_CANT_PATCH_VIEW


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This operation is intended for tables, not views.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process aborts its transaction and terminates.

 Recommendation:
	The user should drop the secondary index and recreate it.


E_DU5039_REFRESH_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	verifydb was not able to perform the REFRESH_LDBS operation.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should attempt to rerun verifydb.


E_DU503A_ILLEGAL_FLAG_COMBO


 Parameters:
	%0c - first flag
	%1c - second flag

 Explanation:
	An illegal combination of arguments to was specified to verifydb.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user should re-run verifydb with valid arguments.


E_DU503B_EMPTY_IIPROCEDURE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Table iiprocedure is a query processing DBMS catalog that contains 
	definitions of stored procedures.
	If it is empty, then the procedures needed for constraints are missing. 
	This is a very severe error.

 System Status:
	verifydb will stop processing, as it is not reasonable to act on this
	database.

 Recommendation:
	The user should attempt to recover the contents of the iiprocedure file
	using the rollforwarddb utility.


E_DU503C_TOO_MANY_VNODES   


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A maximum of 10 names may be specified with the "-sdbname" flag.
	The correct syntax is "name1 [name2 name3 ... name10]" or 
      vnode::name1 [vnode::name2 vnode::name3 ... vnode::name10]". The
	list starts and ends with a quote.  There is exactly one space
	separating each name in the list.  Null lists are not valid.
      All dbnames must be in the same vnode.

 System Status:
	Processing of verifydb stops.

 Recommendation:
	Reissue the verifydb command with the correct syntax.


E_DU503D_RUNMODE_INVALID


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Certain verifydb operations do not have a RUN or RUNSILENT mode.

 System Status:
	The verifydb process reports this error and terminates.

 Recommendation:
	The user should reissue the command using the RUNINTERACTIVE mode.


E_DU503E_INVALID_LOG_FILE


 Parameters:
	%0c - the full path to the invalid log file.

 Explanation:
	verifydb was not able to open an existing verifydb log file. This was
	because verifydb detected that the path to the existing log file 
	did not reference a valid file, but some other operating system object
	such as a directory or a link. 

 System Status:
	verifydb considers it an error if it is unable to open its log
	file.  In such a case, verifydb will print this error message and
	terminate processing.  verifydb will never print this error if the
	"-n" flag is used.

 Recommendation:
	The best thing to do is to remove the object referred to in the 
	error message and run verifydb again. 

	You can bypass logging by using the "-n" flag; however, since verifydb
	outputs lots of messages, use of this flag should be considered
	carefully.



E_DU5100_STAR_CDB_DEST_ONLY

E_DU5100_STAR_CDB_DEST_ONLY
"Cannot destroy coordinator database '%0c'.  \n
Destroy the distributed database '%1c' instead.\n"

 Parameters:
	%0c - coordinator database name
	%1c - distributed database name

 Explanation:
	The user cannot destroy a coordinator database; the only way to
	destroy a coordinator database is through destroying its distributed
	database.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	The user should consider destroying the distributed database if
	they really want to destroy the coordinator database.

	NOTE:  A destroydb of a regular 6.0 or backend will destroy 
	the coordinator database without knowing.


E_DU5101_STAR_CANT_DEST_CDB


 Parameters:
	%0c - coordinator database name

 Explanation:
	The user is attempting to destroy a database that is a coordinator
	database.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	The user cannot destroy a coordinator database without destroying a
	distributed database.


E_DU5102_STAR_DDB_DONT_EXIST


 Parameters:
	%0c - distributed database name

 Explanation:
	Cannot destroy distributed database, because there is no distributed
	database entry in iidatabase.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	    None.


E_DU5107_PRIVATE_STAR


 Parameters:
	%0c - distributed database name

 Explanation:
	The coordinator database created on behalf of the distributed
	database must not be a private database.  This is not allowed,
	because the privileged association will come in as $ingres, and
	$ingres will not have access to the private database.  Control
	access to the coordinator database via GCN (iinetu) rather than
	by trying to create a private distributed database.  The two
	concepts (private and distributed) are mutually exclusive.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Re-issue the command correctly.  The user my create a private database
	or the user may create a distributed database.  The user may not use
	the "-p" flag and /D or /STAR on the same command line.


E_DU5108_STAR_DDB_NAME_TOO_LONG


 Parameters:
	%0d - maximum length of distributed database name

 Explanation:
	If the user does not supply a coordinator database name, distributed
	createdb will attempt to construct one from the distributed database
	name by prepending "ii" to it.  This message means that the resulting 
	coordinator database name will be too long for a database name.

 System Status:
Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	The user can re-enter the distributed database name or specify a
	coordinator database name.


E_DU5109_STAR_INVALID_NAME


 Parameters:
	%0c - text ("Distributed" or "Coordinator")
	%1c - distributed or coordinator database name

 Explanation:
	An invalid database name for either a distributed or coordinator
	database was encountered.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	The user can re-enter a valid distributed database name and/or
	specify a valid coordinator database name.


E_DU510A_STAR_CDB_ALREADY_EXIST


 Parameters:
	%0c - coordinator database name

 Explanation:
	The name specified as the coordinator database name already exists as
	an entry in the iidatabase system catalog.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	The user can re-enter a valid distributed database name or
	specify a valid coordinator database name.


E_DU510B_STAR_DDB_ALREADY_EXIST


 Parameters:
	%0c - distributed database name

 Explanation:
	The name specified as the distributed database name already exists as
	an entry in the iidatabase system catalog.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	The user can re-enter a valid distributed database name or
	specify a valid coordinator database name.


E_DU510C_STAR_DBDB_NOT_LEGAL


 Parameters:
	%0c - distributed database name

 Explanation:
	Cannot use "DBDB" or "IIDBDB" as a coordinator or distributed
	database name.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	The user can re-enter a valid distributed database name or
	specify a valid coordinator database name.


E_DU510D_STAR_DDB_EQS_CDB


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The user specified a distributed database name that is the same as
	the coordinator database name.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	The user can re-enter a valid distributed database name or
	specify a valid coordinator database name.


E_DU510E_STAR_TOO_MANY_ARGS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Too many coordinator or distributed database names were specified
	on the command line.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	The user can re-enter a valid distributed database name or
	specify a valid coordinator database name.


E_DU510F_STAR_CANT_FIND_VNODE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	NMgtAt() on II_GCNxx_LCL_VNODE returned an illegal value.  This should
	be set to the node name.

	Examples:
	  On VMS: node name is rabbit and ii_installation = zz, use:
	            define/group ii_gcnzz_lcl_vnode "rabbit"
	  On Unix: node name is bunny and II_INSTALLATION = zz, use:
	            ingsetenv II_GCNZZ_LCL_VNODE "bunny"

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Check with the DBA or define II_GCNxx_LCL_VNODE.


E_DU5110_SV_NOT_STAR_SERVER


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The current server is a local database (LDB) server.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Check the installation.


E_DU51111_SV_CANT_OPEN_IIDBDB


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Cannot open the iidbdb.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Check with the DBA for permissions.


E_DU5112_SV_BAD_START_NAME


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An invalid database name construct was specified for a Star*View
	parameter.

 System Status:
	Processing aborts.

 Recommendation:
	Check with the DBA for permissions.


E_DU5130_GW_INVALID_NAME


 Parameters:
	%0c - gateway (e.g., RMS)
	%1c - gateway database name

 Explanation:
	This message notifies the user that the gateway database name is
	invalid.

 System Status:
	Process aborts.

 Recommendation:
	The user can re-enter a valid gateway database name.


E_DU5131_GW_DBDB_NOT_LEGAL


 Parameters:
	%0c - gateway database name

 Explanation:
	Cannot use "DBDB" or "IIDBDB" as a gateway database name.

 System Status:
	Process aborts.

 Recommendation:
	The user can re-run using a valid gateway database name.


E_DU6000_UPGRADEDB_USAGE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The correct command-line parameters were not specified on the upgradedb
	command line.  Therefore, a syntax message is printed.

 System Status:
	  Processing will halt.

 Recommendation:
	  Re-enter the command line with the correct syntax.


E_DU6001_FAILED_CNF_READ


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A fatal error was encountered, because upgradedb could not read
	the iidbdb config file.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	Check permissions on database tree and verify that the config
	file exists (if not, you must destroydb the database and recreate it).
	Otherwise, you should fix permissions and quota, then re-issue the
	upgradedb command.


E_DU6002_BAD_IIDBDB_CONNECT


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A fatal error was encountered, because upgradedb could not connect to
	the iidbdb.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	Determine why upgradedb could not connect to the iidbdb (try using
	TM to connect, or examine the error log). Correct that problem,
	then re-issue the upgradedb command.


E_DU6003_UNKNOWN_VERSION


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	dbmsinfo('_version') failed on this database.  This indicates some sort
	of problem with the installation or server.  There may be an error
	message in the server's error log indicating what the problem is.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	Determine what the installation problem is (check the error log).
	Correct that problem, then re-issue the upgradedb command.


E_DU6004_WRONG_VERSION


 Parameters:
	%0c - required version ID string
	%1c - server version ID string

 Explanation:
	upgradedb is targeted to bring a database to a particular level (e.g.,
	"6.4").  If the DBMS server is not at the same level as upgradedb, the
	upgrade cannot occur.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	You may be using the wrong upgradedb frontend executable, or you may
	have a server running that is at the wrong level.   In either case,
	your installation is invalid for upgradedb. You should probably re-do
	the install process, bring the installation back up, then run upgradedb
	again.


E_DU6005_NONEXISTENT_IIDBDB


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Upgradedb is a frontend.  No frontend may run on an installation that
	does not have an iidbdb.  Actually, there should not be any databases
	in an installation that does not have an iidbdb, since createdb is also
	a frontend and also cannot create any user databases until the iidbdb is
	first created.  It does not make sense to be using upgradedb if you do
	not have databases to upgrade, so let us assume that you have an
	installation problem.  Common things that will make it impossible for
	the system to find the iidbdb include: 1) the II_DATABASE symbol is
	not correctly defined (concealed device on VMS); 2) the II_DATABASE
	symbol does not point to the correct location; 3) someone has
	removed the config file (aaaaaaaa.cnf) from the iidbdb's default
	data location, or the disk device that contains the iidbdb is off-line;
	or, 4) II_DBMS_SERVER is defined to point to a non-existent server.

	Another possibility is that you are a release 5 user that is attempting
	to upgrade to release 6 and you are inadvertently using the wrong tool.
	Use convto60 to go from release 5 to release 6; upgradedb is only
	used to go from one version of release 6 to another.  If you are 
	converting from release 5, you must convert the dbdb to iidbdb before
	you do anything else.  The command is:

	  # convto60 -mcontinue -sdbname dbdb

 System Status:
	  The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	  You must fix the installation problem (see explanation) and then
	  verify that you can connect to the iidbdb via TM.  After that is
	  successful, re-issue the upgradedb command.


E_DU6006_INOPERATIVE_IIDBDB


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The iidbdb database has been marked inoperative.  This can be caused
	by many things, but an unsuccessful createdb on iidbdb is most likely.
	In this case, you must destroy the iidbdb by deleting the files in its
	default data directory and then bring down the DBMS server (to clear
	cached info about the iidbdb), restart the server, then create iidbdb,
	using: "createdb -S iidbdb".

	If you already have an installation with other databases in it, attempt
	the upgradedb of the iidbdb again.  If that fails check the upgradedb
	log and the error log.  If neither log gives you a clear picture of the
	problem, call Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

 System Status:
	  The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	  You must determine why the iidbdb is inoperative and correct the
	  problem.


E_DU6007_NONEXISTENT_USER


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is printed when the upgradedb user is not a valid user
	in this installation.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your DBA and have them add you as a DBMS user.  If they
	are not willing to make you a superuser, then you must get a 
	superuser to run the upgradedb for you.


E_DU6008_IIDBDB_WRONG_LEVEL


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The iidbdb is at some unknown level. Since upgradedb cannot determine
	what level the database is at, it cannot convert it to the proper
	level.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user must get the iidbdb to the proper level.  Perhaps it is
	appropriate to recover the iidbdb from the last checkpoint and roll-
	forward.  If that is not possible, then delete the iidbdb default
	data directory, bring down the DBMS server and restart it (to clear the
	server cache), then run "createdb -S iidbdb".


E_DU6009_IIDBDB_UPGR_DISALLOW


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	User databases may not be converted unless the iidbdb is first
	converted.  If a user database is specified for upgradedb before
	the iidbdb is upgraded, then upgradedb will automatically upgrade
	the iidbdb before upgrading the user database.  In this case, the
	DBA is not a superuser, and only superusers may upgrade the iidbdb.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user must get a superuser to upgrade the iidbdb before the user may
	upgradedb his database.


E_DU600A_IIDBDB_JOURNALED


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	upgradedb will automatically disable journaling via the "-A6" flag
	if the database is pre-release 6.3.  In this case, the database is
	post release 6.3, and journaling must be turned off by the user before
	upgradedb will operate on the database.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	Follow the advice provided in this message.


E_DU600B_ACCESS_UPDATE_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	upgradedb could not update the access field in the config file.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	This is probably an installation problem where upgradedb could not
	locate the access field. This can be due to an improperly defined
	II_DATABASE or other location symbol, or due to the device containing
	the database default location going offline.  Ensure that the
	installation is valid and re-issue the upgradedb command.


E_DU600C_CMPT_UPDATE_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	upgradedb could not update the compatibility level fields in the config
	file.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	This is probably an installation problem where upgradedb could not
	locate the access field. This can be due to an improperly defined
	II_DATABASE or other location symbol, or due to the device containing
	the database default location going offline.  Ensure that the
	installation is valid and re-issue the upgradedb command.


E_DU600D_BAD_IIDBDB_RECONNECT


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Upgradedb had to disconnect from the iidbdb and reconnect to ensure
	access to some cached information, or to ensure the correct locking.
	However, the reconnect failed.  This usually indicates that someone
	else has taken a lock on the iidbdb or is in the iidbdb with a fast-
	commit server that is not the same fast-commit server that upgradedb
	is attached to, or there is some sort of installation problem.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	Determine the installation problem (log full, symbols redefined,
	concurrent fast-commit servers operating on the iidbdb, etc.) and
	correct the problem.  Then re-issue the upgradedb command.


E_DU600E_NO_DUMP_INFO


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	upgradedb could not determine the iidump location for this database.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure that your dump location symbol, II_DUMP, is properly defined,
	then re-run upgradedb.


E_DU600F_BAD_DUMP_CLEANUP


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	upgradedb could not delete the config file from the dump location.
	file.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure that the dump location has the appropriate permissions and that
	upgradedb is correctly installed and has the right permissions.  If
	this is all correct, then someone is probably using the dump file for
	an online backup or a recovery, and you will need to wait until the
	operation on the database is complete.


E_DU6010_NOT_SUPERUSER


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Superuser status is required to use the "-all" flag.  The current
	user is not a superuser.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user may specify individual databases for which they are the DBA.
	Or, the user may get a superuser to do the "upgradedb -all" command
	for them.  Alternatively, the user may get the system administrator
	to make them a superuser.


E_DU6011_NOT_DBA


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name
	%1c - database name

 Explanation:
	You are only allowed to upgradedb a database if you are a 
	superuser or the DBA of the database.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user must get an authorized person to run upgradedb for them or they
	may get the system administrator to make them a superuser.


E_DU6012_NONEXISTENT_TARGET


 Parameters:
	%0c - database name

 Explanation:
	upgradedb queried iidatabase for information on a user-specified
	database name, but there was no tuple in iidatabase for that database.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to re-enter the upgradedb command with the correct
	specification of the database name.


E_DU6013_NO_MORE_MEMORY


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	upgradedb ran out of memory while trying to build a list of target
	databases.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	The user may want to tune the operating-system setup, or the user may
	re-enter the upgradedb command for each database individually rather
	than specifying the "-all" flag.


E_DU6014_DBNAME_TWICE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The user entered the command line incorrectly.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process stops.

 Recommendation:
	Re-issue the command using correct syntax.


E_DU6015_BAD_CLIENT_NM


 Parameters:
	%0c - parameter name

 Explanation:
	The special client name "nofeclients" appeared on the command line
	along with some other client name(s). When "nofeclients" is specified,
	no other dictionary client names can appear. The presence of the
	dictionary client name "nofeclients" tells createdb to not create
	any front-end catalogs in the new database.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb process exits, and the database is not upgraded.

 Recommendation:
	Check the dictionary client names you specified on the upgradedb
	command line. Dictionary client names should follow the database name
	at the end of the command line.


E_DU6016_CANT_CRE_DIR


 Parameters:
	%0c - subdirectory name

 Explanation:
	upgradedb could not build a path to the II_CONFIG:[username]
	directory, or it built the path but was unable to create the
	directory.  This can occur if the user's login is not a legal
	user name, if the II_SYSTEM location is not defined, if there 
	is a shortage of disk space on the disk containing II_CONFIG, or 
	if the directory tree permissions are incorrect.

 System Status:
	upgradedb exits, and the database is not upgraded.

 Recommendation:
	Check the items mentioned in the explanation and correct as appropriate.
	Or, if the user prefers, re-direct standard output and then re-run
	upgradedb using the "-n" flag, which will suppress output to the
	upgradedb log file.


E_DU6017_CANT_OPEN_LOG


 Parameters:
	%0c - log file path

 Explanation:
	upgradedb could not open its log file: II_CONFIG:[username]upgrade.log
	This can occur if there is a shortage of disk space on the disk
	containing II_CONFIG, or if the directory tree permissions are
	incorrect.  (If II_CONFIG is not defined, the system will default to
	II_SYSTEM/ingres/files.)

 System Status:
	upgradedb exits, and the database is not upgraded.

 Recommendation:
	Check the items mentioned in the explanation and correct as appropriate.
	Or, if the user prefers, re-direct standard output and then re-run
	upgradedb using the "-n" flag, which will suppress output to the
	upgradedb log file.


E_DU6018_CANT_CSINITIATE


 Parameters:
	%0d - status returned by CSinitiate()

 Explanation:
	CSinitiate() must be called before any LG or LK routines are
	called so that access to shared memory is coordinated.

 System Status:
	upgradedb exits, and the database is not upgraded.

 Recommendation:
	Check the items mentioned in the explanation and correct as appropriate.


E_DU6019_CANT_UPGRADESQL92


 Parameters:
	none

 Explanation:
      Upgradedb doesn't allow to upgrade from non-sql92 to the
      sql92 installation.

 System Status:
	upgradedb exits, and the database is not upgraded.

 Recommendation:
      Use cbf and select the Preferences menu item and then set
      "ISO_ENTRY_SQL92" parameter to "OFF".


E_DU601A_NOUPDATE_SYSCAT


 Parameters:
	%0c - The catalog being updated
	%1d - The Ingres error code returned to upgradedb

 Explanation:
	The upgrade process attempted to update a system catalog, but the
	update failed.  This may be caused by a lack of disk space in the
	database's root data area;  it may also be caused by a lack of
	transaction log space.

 System Status:
	The upgrade is aborted.  The database will be unusable until the
	problem is corrected, and upgradedb is re-run against the database.

 Recommendation:
	Free up disk space, increase the transaction log size, or resolve
	such other problem as may be indicated by the error code and
	error log.  Then, re-run upgradedb for this database.


E_DU6500_FAIL_UCTR_COMASST_LOAD


 Parameters:
      none

 Explanation:
	For DU6500-DU651B: Createmdb cannot load tables 
	for the particular category. 

 System Status:
      Createmdb exits, and the database objects for mdb are not created.

 Recommendation:
      recreate the mdb database and rerun createmdb to load the tables.

 Parameters:

 Explanation:
	createdb was specified with both -i and -n options. Only 
	one unicode normalization form is allowed for a database. 

 System Status:
	The createdb process exits, and the database is not created.

 Recommendation:
	Please specify only one unicode normalization form. Valid options
	are -n (Normal form D) or -i (Normal form C).


E_DU6521_UNORM_NFC_WITH_NFD


E_EO0000_EVTBADNAME	"Event '%0c' is unknown.\n


 Arguments:
	0	This is the name the user gave.

 Explanation:
	The user gave a name for an event that is not known to the
	system.

 System Status:
	In the 4GL compiler this will be reported as an error and
	the 4GL will not be successfully compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Check the documentation to find the legal event names.


E_EO0001_EVTBADCLASS	"Incorrect class of object for event '%0c'\n


 Arguments:
	0	This is the name of the event.

	1	This is a list of the allowed classes that the
		event can be issued on.

 Explanation:
	The user tried to do an ON event for an object that doesn't
	generate the given event.

 System Status:
	In the 4GL compiler this will be reported as an error and
	the 4GL will not be successfully compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Check the documentation to see what events are legal for
	different kinds of objects.


E_EO0002_FLUSH_NOWINDOW	"Flush invoked on non-window object.\n


 Explanation:
	The flush method was applied to an object that does not
	have a window available to it.  In general flush can only
	be done to a procedure, or to a procedure that has a frame
	as an ancestor.

 System Status:
	The Flush is not done.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the invocation so that Flush is applied to an
	object that has a window available to it.


E_EO0003_FLUSH_WAIT	"Error during flush.\n


 Explanation:
	The system uses the waitfor method to implement the
	flush method.  During the execution of a flush, a waitfor
	could not be done.  The problem with the waitfor will
	be reported, and must be corrected for the waitfor to
	run.

 System Status:
	The Flush is not done.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the previous error to get the flush to succeed.


E_EO0004_OBJTO3GL  "Objects and arrays can not be passed to 3GL procedures.\n


 Explanation:
	3GL procedures can not be passed an object or an array from
	Windows 4GL.

 System Status:
	The 3GL procedure will not be called.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the object or array parameters.


E_EO0005_BEEP_NOWINDOW		"Beep invoked on non-window object.\n


 Explanation:
	The beep method was applied to an object that does not
	have a window available to it.  In general beep can only
	be done to a frame, or to a procedure that has a frame
	as an ancestor.

 System Status:
	The beep is not done.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the invocation so that beep is applied to an
	object that has a window available to it.


E_EO0006_PROCEXEC_SENDEVENT	"SendUserEvent invoked on a procedure.\n


 Explanation:
	The SendUserEvent although defined on ProcExec is an error.
	SendUserEvent can only legally be applied to FrameExecs.

 System Status:
	The event is not sent.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the invocation so that SendUserEvent is only applied
	to a frame.


E_EO0007_LOG_OPEN	"Cannot open file temporary file %0c for debugger log."


 Explanation:
	Cannot open a temporary file for the debugger log.

 System Status:
	On screen log output is not available.  If log output has
	been redirected, it will continue to go there.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the situation which makes it impossible to open temporary
	file.


E_EO0008_LOG_WRITE	"Cannot write temporary file for debugger log."


 Explanation:
	Write failed on debugger log.

 System Status:
	On screen log output is not available.  If log output has
	been redirected, it will continue to go there.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the situation which caused the write failure.


E_EO0009_INVALID_WINDOWICON "The bitmap is not valid for window icons.\n


 Explanation:
	Attempt to define a window icon failed.

 System Status:
	The window icon is unchanged.

 Recommendation:
	Try again with another icon.

E_EO0018_SESS_NOT_CONNECTED	


 Explanation:
	The state of the DBSESSIONOBJECT in question was not DS_CONNECTED.
	This means that the DBSESSIONOBJECT is not connected to a database
	session, and thus cannot become the session for a frame or procedure.

 System Status:
	The frame or procedure will keep its previous session.

 Recommendation:
	Connect the database session before attaching it to a frame or
	procedure.


E_EO001A_SESS_NULL


 Explanation:
	The DBSESSIONOBJECT in question is NULL.  The DBSESSIONOBJECT is 
	not connected to a database session, and thus cannot become 
	the session for a frame or procedure.

 System Status:
	The frame or procedure will keep its previous session.

 Recommendation:
	Set the current frame or procedure's DBsession attribute to a 
	non-NULL DBsessionObject.


E_EO001B_OBJBYREF  


 Explanation:
	3GL procedures can not be passed an object or an array BYREF from
	Windows 4GL.

 System Status:
	The 3GL procedure will not be called.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the BYREF keyword from object or array parameters.


E_EO001C_CANNOT_SET_ISGRIDON


E_EO001D_NOTAFRAME "Sender is not a frame, nor is it running under a frame.\n\


 Explanation:
	The SendUserEvent was issued from a procedure in an application
	which has not yet started any frames.  Since such procedures cannot
	receive user events, you cannot specify an event to be sent back
	to the calling component on error if the calling component is
	such a procedure.

 System Status:
	The userevent will be sent, but the errorevent parameter will
	be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the errorevent parameter, or send the event from a frame
	or from a procedures called from a frame.


E_EO001E_DYNEXPR_NOT_LVALUE


 Explanation:
	The setvalue method was invoked on a dynamic expression, but
	the dynamic expression is not a legal left-hand side for an assignment.

 System Status:
	The method will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Change the dynamic expression or else don't invoke setvalue on it.


E_EO001F_DYNEXPR_NOT_FIELD


 Explanation:
	The getfield method was invoked on a dynamic expression, but
	the dynamic expression does not specify a field.

 System Status:
	The method will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Change the dynamic expression or else don't invoke getfield on it.


E_EO0020_DYNEXPR_BAD_CONTEXT


 Explanation:
	A dynamic expression was created specifying a context
	(a frame, procedure, field script, or event block) which has now
	terminated.  No getvalue, setvalue, or getfield method may be
	invoked against such a dynamic expression.

 System Status:
	The method will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
	Don't do this.


E_EO0021_DYNEXPR_UNINITIALIZED


 Explanation:
	The message says it all.

 System Status:
	The method will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
	Don't do this.


E_EO0022_DYNEXPR_NOT_EVALUATED


 Explanation:
	The Windows/4GL interpreter detected a fatal error when it tried to
	evaluate a dynamic expression for a getvalue, setvalue, or getfield
	method.  A subsequent message will specify the error.  Likely causes
	are (1) a VALUE or FIELD parameter of improper type was specified when
	invoking the method, or (2) a subscript in the dynamic expression
	is out of range.

 System Status:
	The method will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error(s) reported in subsequent message(s).


E_EO0023_DEFERCONFIG_NOWINDOW  "DeferConfigure invoked on non-window object.\n


 Explanation:
	The DeferConfigure method was applied to an object that does not
	have a window available to it.  In general DeferConfigure can only
	be done to a procedure, or to a procedure that has a frame
	as an ancestor.

 System Status:
	The DeferConfigure is not done.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the invocation so that DeferConfigure is applied to an
	object that has a window available to it.


E_EO0024_NOTCURRENT	"Invalid invocation of SendSuperclass.\n\


 Explanation:
	SendSuperclass was invoked on a MethodExec which is not the currently
	executing method.  The SendSuperclass invocation will be ignored.

 System Status:
	SendSuperclass is not done.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the invocation so that SendSuperclass is applied to the
	currently executing method (curmethod)


 Explanation:
	The SendSuperclass method implicitly passed the ancestor class's
	method the same arguments that were passed to the calling method.

 System Status:
	The arguments specified in 4GL will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the arguments from the SendSuperclass invocation.


E_EO0026_NOSUPERCLASS	


E_EO0027_NOSUPERMETHOD	"No ancestor class supersedes %0c.\n\


 Explanation:
	SendSuperclass was invoked on a method which does not supersede
	another version of this method.

 System Status:
	SendSuperclass is not done.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the invocation so that SendSuperclass is applied only to methods
	which supersede an ancestor class's version of that method.


E_EO0028_NONUNIQUEAPP "Non-unique included application name.\n\


 Explanation:
      All application names must be unique within a hierarchy of included
      applications.

 System Status:
      The application cannot be run.

 Recommendation:
      One of the applications must be renamed or removed from the included
      application hierarchy.


E_EO0029_EVTBADROWCLASS	"Incorrect class of rows of object for event '%0c'\n


 Arguments:
	0	This is the name of the event (presumably begins with 'child').

	1	This is a list of the allowed classes that the
		event can be issued on.

	2	This is the name of the event with the leading 'child'
		(if present) stripped off.

 Explanation:
	The user tried to do an ON CHILD<event> for a COLUMNFIELD object,
	but its rows don't generate <event>, nor do any of their descendants.

 System Status:
	In the 4GL compiler this will be reported as an error and
	the 4GL will not be successfully compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Check the documentation to see what events are legal for
	different kinds of objects.


E_EO002A_DYNEXPR_BAD_CONTEXT


 Explanation:
	The message says it all.

 System Status:
	The createdynexpr method will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
	Don't do this.

E_GL4001_MO_ALREADY_ATTACHED:SS42502_DUPL_OBJECT


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
      The internal MOattach() routine detected an attempt to duplicate
      an MO object that was already attached.  This isn't allowed, and
      the original object was left intact.  This is a programming error.

 System Status:
      The MO object space may not be the way the programmer intended.
      Depending on the object, this may or may not affect the system
      status.

E_GW0221_GWS_ALTER_ERROR:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
	This message is logged when attempting to alter the characteristics
	of a gateway session.  Currently, this occurs when there is an 
	internal error when translating the name of a gateway core catalog.
	An additional message is issued that identifies the nature of the
	translation error along with the name of the catalog.

 System Status:
	The gateway session is terminated.

 Recommendation:
      Inform your INGRES administrator, who should contact Ingres Technical
      Support. The contents of the error log should be preserved for analysis
      by Ingres Technical Support.

E_GW0303_SCC_ERROR_ERROR:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
      This message is logged when an internal error occurs in the scc_error()
      call. The scc_error() function is used to send error messages to the
      user; this error indicates that the internal error occurred during the
      handling of an error message that was to be sent to the user. The
      error message in question was NOT sent to the user.

      Error messages in the immediate vicinity of this message in the error
      log may provide additional details about the operation that was in
      progress when the error occurred. This information may be helpful to
      Ingres Technical Support.

 System Status:
      The current query is aborted, and message E_SC0206 is (usually) given
      to the user who was running the query. Several messages in addition
      to this message may have been logged in the error log.

 Recommendation:
      Inform your INGRES administrator, who should contact Ingres Technical
      Support. The contents of the error log should be preserved for analysis
      by Ingres Technical Support. If the query which generated this error
      can be determined, that information would be useful as well.

E_GW050C_NOT_POSITIONED:SS50005_GW_ERROR


E_GW050D_DATA_CVT_ERROR:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
      This error message is used by GWF to pass back to DMF the fact that
      a data conversion error occurred in the gateway. The data conversion
      error was handled by taking the following actions:

          1) Reporting a low-level, conversion-specific error message to the
             user through a direct call to scc_error().
          2) Aborting the processing of the record which was being accessed.
          3) Returning without logging any error message text to the error
	       log.

      This error message indicates to DMF that no further work should be
      performed on this query; the query should be aborted. However, no
      error messages need be logged to the error log -- this is a "user"
      error, not an "internal" error, and needs no traceback.

 System Status:
      The current query will be aborted, if possible (not all gateways can
      abort queries). A "friendly" error message has already been sent to
      the user. No subsequent error messages need to be sent or logged for
      this error.

 Recommendation:
      Determine what caused the data conversion error and correct it. Then
      re-execute the query. If possible, the gateway has aborted the query
      and backed out the operations it performed; however, not all gateways
      support aborting of query operations, so some work may have already
      been performed by this query.


E_GW050E_ALREADY_REPORTED:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
      This message is used to notify DMF (the caller of GWF) that GWF has
      encountered an error but has already reported the error. No additional
      error reporting need be done. DMF should return to its caller (QEF),
      and query cleanup and recovery should be performed normally.

 System Status:
      The query will be aborted, but all other processing continues normally.

 Recommendation:
      The user should never see this message. If so, it should be reported
      to Ingres Technical Support as a bug.


E_GW050F_DEFAULT_STATS_USED:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
      This message is used to notify the user that the foreign data file
      could not be found.  At registration time, this means that a default
      value for the number of pages will be used.  When creating a view, the
      view is successfully created based on the table definition.

 System Status:
      Processing continues normally; for a register table operation, default
      value is used for pages.

 Recommendation:
      REGISTER TABLE:
      If the user wants a more accurate size estimate for the file, the table
      should be removed and re-registered when the underlying data file is
      accessible.

      CREATE VIEW:
      No user action required.

      The table must be accessible before any queries can be run on it.

E_GW5012_RMS_REWIND_ERROR:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0x - internal stream identifier (in hex)
      %1c - RMS error code (in hex)

 Explanation:
      This is the standard error message used to log any error in the
      RMS SYS$FIND service call when an RMS file is being positioned for
      an indexed search (a search where a key value was used to select
      a subset of the file). The message provides the RMS error code and
      the key number and key value which were provided to the call.

 System Status:
      The transaction will be aborted. Depending on the reason for the
      error, the RMS file may or may not be usable by other transactions.
      The RMS gateway can still be used to access other RMS files.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the problem that prevented the file from being positioned.


E_GW5013_RMS_BAD_INDEX_VALUE:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c - user input

 Explanation:
      An invalid key reference number in the "from" field of a
      REGISTER INDEX statement for an RMS secondary index was
      encountered.

 System Status:
      The index registration will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
      Re-enter the index registration with a valid key reference number.


E_GW5014_RMS_RFA_TOO_LONG:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0x - maximum block number supported by the gateway (in hex)
      %1x - maximum record offset supported by the gateway (in hex)
      %2x - actual block number of fetched record (in hex)
      %3x - actual offset into that block of fetched record (in hex)

 Explanation:
      We must map 6-byte RMS RFAs into 4-byte INGRES TIDs.  A
      record was fetched whose virtual block number (as encoded
      in its RFA) was too big to be mapped into a TID.

 System Status:
      The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
      Break the file up into smaller files, none of which has more
      virtual blocks than the gateway can support.

E_GW5483_RMS_FROM_INGRES_ERROR:SS50005_GW_ERROR


E_GW5484_RMS_DATA_CVT_ERROR:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
      This error message indicates a recoverable data conversion error within
      the RMS gateway exits. This error typically occurs when ADF reports
      that it cannot properly perform the indicated conversion between RMS and
      INGRES data formats. The conversion may have been from RMS to INGRES
      or from INGRES to RMS; either type of conversion can produce this error.

      The user does not see this error, nor is it logged to the error log. It
      exists internally so that callers of the RMS exits can determine whether
      an error which occurred was a data conversion error or an unexpected
      internal error, and can modify their behavior accordingly.

      Typically, this error should be remapped to a generic GWF error message
      by the GWF layer.

 System Status:
      The query is aborted, if possible. An ADF error message has already
      been formatted and sent to the user at this point. This error code need
      neither be formatted nor logged; it should just be returned back up to
      the GWF layer.

 Recommendation:
      None. The user should NEVER see this error; it is for internal program
      use only. If this error does ever appear to the user, contact Ingres
	Technical Support.


E_GW5485_RMS_RECORD_TOO_SHORT:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
      This error is typically caused by a mistake in table registration, such
      that one or more fields has an offset past the end of the RMS record.

 System Status:
      The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
      If the table has been incorrectly registered, the user should do a
      "remove table", then re-register the table.  If the wrong file is
      being accessed, this may be due to the wrong logical name being used,
      or an incorrect logical name translation.  If the record is variable
      length, all records must be long enough for the offsets specified.

 Parameters
	1	The name of the database that couldn't be opened.

 Explanation:
	The given database could not be opened.  All attempts are made
	to get the specific DBMS error that is causing the problem
	and if that error can be gotten, it is printed too.

 System Status:
	This depends on why the database is being opened.  If the database
	is being opened to start running an application, the application
	will not be run.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the problem identified by the DBMS error.  If not DBMS
	error is given, try opening the database using the terminal
	monitor to see if a better error can be generated.

 Parameters
	0	The name of the class of the array. For example, if
		the array variable is defined as ARRAY OF StringObject
		this will be StringObject.

	1	The name of the class of the value.

 Explanation:
	A reference value was assigned to an array variable.  This
	is not legal.  Only an array can be assigned to an array variable.

 System Status:
	The value will not be moved into the array.

 Recommendation:
	Fix this statement so that an array value is assigned to
	the array variable.


E_OM0045_ARRAY	"The class of an array value does not match the array variable.\n


 Parameters
	0	The name of the class of the array. For example, if
		the array variable is defined as ARRAY OF StringObject
		this will be 'Array of StringObject'.

	1	The name of the class of the values rows.

 Explanation:
	For two arrays to be assignment compatible, the classes of the
	two arrays must be the same.  This is not the case for
	this statement.

 System Status:
	The value will not be moved into the array.

 Recommendation:
	Fix this statement so the arrays have the same class.


E_OM0046_BADCLASS	"'%1c' is not a subclass of '%0c'.\n


 Parameters:
	0	The name of the class of the variable.

	the variable.  In this case, the class of the value is a subclass
	of the variable.

 System Status:
	The value will not be assigned to the reference variable.

 Recommendation:
	Make the value a subclass of the reference variable.


E_OM0047_BADCLASSBYREF	"Cannot pass '%1c' to '%0c' BYREF.\n

 Arguments:
	0	This is the number of parameters that the called object
		accepts.

	1	This is the number of the positional parameter that
		was passed that exceeds the number.

 Explanation:
      The parameter list for the call of an object included too many
	positional parameters.

 System Status:
	The exact action depends on the object that was called.  Most
	will simply continue executing by ignoring this parameter.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the extra parameters from the parameter list and
	check the documentation to find the correct number of parameters.


 Explanation:
	This string is used in a STprintf statement to construct a
	name for a CursorObject.  The %d and %s are arguments for
	the STprintf call.  The %d will be the line number that
	the cursor object was opened on, and the %s is the name
	of the frame or procedure that the cursor object was
	opened in.

	The string resulting from the STprintf will be used in
	place of the DBMS cursor name in an error like E_US0899.

	This allows 4GL to issue an error like:
          E_US0899 line 1, Cursor '(Cursorobject opened at line 10 of cursors)**          already open.
	Instead of:
          E_US0899 line 1, Cursor 'sph_15' already open.


 Explanation:
	This string is used in the errors E_OM0044 to E_OM00XX in place
	of a class name if the class could not be found at runimte.

 Explanation:
	A procedure was invoked with a temporary table parameter, either from
	the triggering of a statement level rule or the issuance of an
	"execute procedure" statement with a global temporary table actual
	parameter. However, the procedure did not have a corresponding "set of" 
	formal parameter. Procedures called with temporary table parameters must 
	have a corresponding "set of" formal parameter whose definition matches 
	that of the temporary table.


 System Status:
	The query will be terminated.

 Recommendation:
	Recode procedure with an appropriate "set of" formal parameter.

	table parameter to a procedure whose "set of" formal parameter didn't
	exactly match the table definition. The "set of" parameter must
	match the table definition in the number of columns and the name,
	type, length and nullability of each of the columns.


 System Status:
	The query will be terminated.

 Parameters:
	%0c - element name in procedure SET OF list

 Explanation:
	A procedure with a "set of" formal parameter was called as the result
	of a triggered rule. An element was defined in the "set of" list
	which is not null with no default, yet has no corresponding actual
	parameter in the "execute procedure" clause of the rule definition. If
	a "set of" element is defined not null with no default, there MUST be
	a matching element in the "execute procedure" clause.

 System Status:
	The query will be terminated.

 Recommendation:
	Fix either the procedure definition or rule definition and retry the
	triggering statement.

      This error will occur when executing a procedure via the "EXECUTE
      PROCEDURE" statement or via the firing of a rule. This message is
	analgous to QE0123 (detected at runtime).

 System Status:
      If this is an "EXECUTE PROCEDURE" statement, the statement is aborted.
      If this is a rule invocation, the original query triggering the rule
      is aborted with a fatal error.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the parameter name in the "EXECUTE PROCEDURE" statement or
      "EXECUTE PROCEDURE" clause in the "CREATE RULE" statement.

 Parameters:
      %0c - utility name
      %1c - estimated number of tables from iirelation
      %2c - database name

 System Status:
      An initial guess for space allocation is made by a count on
      iirelation for the maximum number of tables which can be optimized.
      This error occurs if iirelation is grossly out of date, either
      100 new relations have been created, or some of the relations in the
      utility parameter list reference relations which do not exist.

 Recommendation:
      If a parameter list references relations directly with the "-r" option,
      make sure all relations do exist.  If new or temp table creation rate
	is high, run the utility using only the "-r" option or run the utility
	at a time of less concurrent table creation activity.

      If this does not correct problem, contact Ingres Corporation 
      Technical Support.

      a floating point number. This should never happen.

 Recommendation:
      Please report the problem to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


W_OP095D_UDT:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
      %0c - attribute name
      %1c - table name

 Explanation:
      The user attempted to create statistics on a column with
      a User Defined Datatype (UDT).

 System Status:
	The request will be ignored and optimizedb will continue creating
	statistics on the remaining columns.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_OP095E_BAD_UNIQUE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
      %0c - unique flag value
      %1c - attribute name
      %2c - table name

 Explanation:
      The user attempted to read in statistics from a file and an
      invalid unique flag value was specified.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error in the file; ensure that the value is either
	"Y" or "N".


W_OP095F_WARN_UNIQUE:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
      %0c - unique flag value
      %1c - attribute name
      %2c - table name

 Explanation:
      When reading in statistics from a file, optimizedb discovered that
	the unique flag value does not conform with the optimizer rules
	(see below).

 System Status:
	The value and statistics will be stored as requested.

 Recommendation:
      The user should consider changing the unique flag value according
      to the optimizer rule below:

        if the number_of_unique_values >= 0.9 * row_count
            set value to `Y'
        else
            set value to `N'

      where number_of_unique_values is the number of unique values in the
      relation (labeled "unique values:") in the statistics file, and
      row_count is the number of rows in the relation (labeled "rows:")
      in the statistics file.


E_OP0960_BAD_LENGTH:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


W_OP0961_SQLWARN1:SS01000_WARNING

 Recommendation:
      Please report the problem to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


W_OP0966_SQLWARN6:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
      An active transaction was abnormally terminated.  Possible cause
	is a serialization error (e.g., deadlock, log full).

 Recommendation:
      Re-execute your request.


W_OP0967_SQLWARN7:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:

E_OP0968_OPTDB_IANDO:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


E_OP0969_OPTIX_NOATTS:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
      %0c - database name
      %1c - table/index name

 Explanation:
      An attempt was made to create statistics on individual attributes
	of a secondary index or a base table with the -zcpk option. When an
	index (in the -r option) or -zcpk is specified, a single composite
	histogram is built on all key columns and -a parameters are not 
	permitted.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the -a parameters accompanying the -r specification and
	rerun optimizedb.


W_OP096A_OPTIX_1ATT:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
      %0c - database name
      %1c - table/index name

 Explanation:
      An attempt was made to create statistics on an index or a base table
	with the -zcpk option. This operation will build a composite
	histogram on the concatenation of the key columns. However, either
	the table uses the heap structure or its key structure contains only 
	1 attribute making this a useless operation, since the resulting 
	histogram will not be used in query optimization. The statistics 
	should be run on the corresponding attribute in the base table.

 Recommendation:
	Run statistics on the corresponding attribute in the base table.


W_OP0970:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
	A serialization error was returned by the DBMS, and the transaction
      has been automatically restarted.

 System Status:
      Execution will continue.

 Recommendation:
      None required. However, if this happens often, the DBA should
      consider increasing the size of the log file.


E_OP0971:SS40001_SERIALIZATION_FAIL


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
	The transaction was automatically restarted and it failed again.

 System Status:
      Execution of optimizedb/statdump will be terminated.

 Recommendation:
      Please report the problem to your DBA. Consider increasing
      the size of the log file.


E_OP0972:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
      %0d - number of rows in table holding sample data
      %1f - number of unique values in table holding sample data
      %2d - number of rows in table on which statistics are created

 Explanation:
      When scaling the number of unique values for sampled statistics,
      an internal error occurred.

 Recommendation:
      Please report the problem and displayed data to Ingres Corporation 
	Technical Support.


W_OP0973_TOTAL_COUNT_OFF:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
      %0c - sum total of normalized cell counts
      %1c - table name
      %2c - column name
      %3c - expected error value

 Explanation:
      All normalized cell counts are expected to add up to 1.0.
      When reading statistics in, the cell counts are added up
      and a check is made whether the result is within error
      margin (1 +/- delta). The delta value takes into account the
      number of cells added. If the result is outside the error
      margin, a warning is issued. Statistics will be stored in catalogs.

 Recommendation:
      Check the cell count values.


E_OP0974_BAD_MAX_COLS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0d - error code passed by conversion routine
      %1c - value of MAX_COLUMNS (from iidbcapabilities)

 Explanation:
      An error occurred when converting an ASCII number to an integer
      format.

 Recommendation:
      Check the MAX_COLUMNS value in the iidbcapabilities catalog.


E_OP0975_STAT_COUNT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0d - number of char stats (nunique or density) retrieved
      %1d - histogram value length

 System Status:
      Creation of statistics for the given column will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
      Please make sure that the number of character-set statistics
      following the words "unique chars:" and "char set densities:"
	agrees with value length.


E_OP0980_ADI_PM_ENCODE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
      %0d - error code passed by ADF facility
      %1c - column name

      %2c - table name

 Explanation:
      An ADF error occurred when executing the adc_compare() function.

 Recommendation:
      If other messages are not present and the cause of the error cannot be
      identified, please contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_OP0984_NO_PRIV_TABLE_STATS:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The optimizedb or statdump utility was invoked by a user without the
	necessary privileges.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure you have appropriate privileges before running these utilities.


E_OP0985_NOHIST:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - column name
	%1c - data type

 Explanation:
	Optimizedb cannot be run on columns whose type does not support 
	histograms (e.g. all the BLOB types).

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure all columns explicitly identified in "-a" parameters support
	the creation of histograms.


E_OP0990_BAD_RPTFACTOR:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
      %0f - repetition factor value
      %1c - column name
      %2c - table name
      %3d - row count

 Explanation:
      When reading statistics from a file, optimizedb found a repetition
	factor value which is outside of the expected range. Repetition factor
	should be 1.0 or greater, but never greater than the number of rows
	in the relation for which it is specified.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the repetition factor value and reexecute.


W_OP0991_INV_RPTFACTOR:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
      %0f - repeat factor value
      %1c - column name
      %2c - table name

 Explanation:
      When reading statistics from a file, optimizedb found a repetition
	factor value which is outside of the expected range. Repetition factor
	multiplied by the number of unique values is expected to be close to
	row count.

 Recommendation:
      Consider correcting the repetition factor value.


W_OP0992_ROWCNT_INCONS:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
      %0c - column name
      %1c - table name

 Explanation:
      Statdump encountered a histogram which was built when the table row 
	count was significantly different (+/- 20%) than it is now. The value
	distribution in the histogram may not reflect the current state of
	the column.

 Recommendation:
      Consider running optimizedb to rebuild the histogram.


E_OP0993_XRBADMIX:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
      %0c - utility name (Optimizedb or Statdump)
      %1c - optional text ("'xr' and 'r'" or "'xr' and 'a'")

 Explanation:
      Use of the "-xr" command line options precludes the use of either the
	"-r" or "-a" options.

 Recommendation:
      Recode the command and retry.

      %0x - compression options received (in hex)

 Explanation:
      This message is issued when opc_ahd_build() examines the pst_compress
      options in the PST_RESTAB structure, which is supposed to contain the
      compression options for the table which is being selected or retrieved
      into, and discovers that the wrong bits are set.

      Certain of the bits in this flag word are for the internal use of the
      SQL parser only, and should have been cleared before the query plan was
      passed to the optimizer.

      To recover from this situation, the optimizer logs this message and
      ignores all the compression options.

 System Status:
      The table which is created does not use compression.

 Recommendation:
      Please report this error message to Ingres Corporation Technical 
      Support. If the compression characteristics of the table are important, 
      it can be modified to the desired storage structure, and the 
      compression options can be re-specified at that time.

	if the closing double-quote was inadvertently omitted.

 System Status:
	The program continues; the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the text of the query and reenter.


E_PS0324_DELIM_ID_TOO_SHORT:SS42506_INVALID_IDENTIFIER


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A delimited identifier with a body of length 0 was specified.  It is
	possible that the user was attempting to escape a double-quote (") with
	another double-quote, but in 6.4, the body of a delimited identifier
	must satisfy the rules for a valid identifier.

 System Status:
	The program continues; the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the text of the query and reenter.


E_PS0325_MISSING_DELIM_ID_END:SS42506_INVALID_IDENTIFIER

	The program continues; the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Specify a different timeout value, or define the "OPF ACTIVE"
	server startup flag to be equal to the "CONNECTED_SESSIONS" flag.


E_PS0353_NAME_STRING_TOO_LONG:SS42506_INVALID_IDENTIFIER


 Parameters:
	%0c - string literal supplied by the user
	%1d - maximum length of a valid identifier

 Explanation:
	The length of a literal string supplied by the user to represent a
	name of a user, group, or role exceeds the maximum length of a valid
	identifier. Therefore, the string cannot possibly represent a
	valid user, group, or role name.

 System Status:
	The program continues; the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and reenter.

	%0c - name of the prepared query supplied by the user
	%1c - current effective user name
	%2c - user name in effect when the query was prepared

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to execute a prepared query, but the current
	effective user identifier is different from that in effect when the
	query was prepared.  Since the query was prepared in a context which
	was different from the current one, we will take a conservative approach
	and prevent the user from executing the query.

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to execute a prepared query, but the current
	effective group identifier is different from that in effect when the
	query was prepared.  Since the query was prepared in a context which
	was different from the current one, we will take a conservative approach
	and prevent the user from executing the query.

 System Status:
	The program continues; the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user can either change the effective identifier to match that
	which was in effect when the query was prepared or prepare that query
	in the current context.

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to execute a prepared query, but the current
	effective role identifier is different from that in effect when the
	query was prepared.  Since the query was prepared in a context which
	was different from the current one, we will take a conservative approach
	and prevent the user from executing the query.

 System Status:
	The program continues; the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user can either change the effective identifier to match that
	which was in effect when the query was prepared or prepare that query
	in the current context.

 Explanation:
	The user has defined a cursor on a table or view, but they lack
	privileges required to update some of its attributes.

	We no longer prevent a user from explicitly or implicitly specifying a
	"FOR UPDATE" clause containing the name of a column which they may not
	UPDATE (this behavior is compliant with ANSI SQL92), but we still
	prevent them from updating this column.

 System Status:
	The program continues; the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and reenter.

	the use of the owner.table construct, and the owner is different
	from the current user.

 System Status:
	The program continues; the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and reenter.


E_PS042A_CANT_GRANT_VIEW_PERM:SS42503_INSUF_PRIV


 Parameters:
	%0c - view name as specified by the user

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to GRANT a permit on a view, but at least one of the
	underlying relations is not owned by them.

 System Status:
	The program continues; the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and reenter.


E_PS042C_CANT_GRANT_DBP_PERM:SS42503_INSUF_PRIV


 Parameters:
	%0c - database procedure name as specified by the user

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to GRANT a permit on a database procedure, but it was
	determined that the user may not grant permits on it because some object
	(i.e., table, view, database procedure, or dbevent) used in its
	definition did not exist; or, the user may not grant required
	privilege(s) on some object used in its definition.

 System Status:
	Permit on this database procedure will not be created; other objects
	(if any) mentioned in the statement will be processed in turn.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and reenter.


E_PS042E_DROPSYN_NOT_OBJ_OWNER:SS42503_INSUF_PRIV


 Parameters:
	%0c - synonym owner as specified by the user

 Explanation:
	The user entered "DROP SYNONYM owner.synonym_name...", and the owner
	is different from the current user.

 System Status:
	Synonym owned by another user will not be dropped.

	If any other synonyms were listed in this statement, they will be
	processed in turn.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and reenter.


E_PS042F_UNGRANTABLE_DBPROC:SS42503_INSUF_PRIV


 Parameters:
	%0c - database procedure name as specified by the user
	%1c - database procedure owner

 Explanation:
	While trying to recreate a database procedure P1 which is not owned by
	the current user, it was determined that the permits on P1 shall not
	be honored.  This can occur if P1 uses at least one table or database
	procedure which is not owned by the owner of P1.  Since we disallow
	users to grant access to objects not owned by them, we will similarly
	disregard any permits which may have been issued on P1.

 System Status:
	The program continues; the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Contact the owner of the database procedure or change the query which
	caused the error to not use the database procedure in question.


I_PS0451_SYN_WAS_SPECIFIED:SS5000F_TEXTUAL_INFO


 Parameters:
	%0c - query
	%0c - synonym name
	%0c - synonym owner
	%0c - object for which the synonym is defined
	%0c - object name

 Explanation:
	This is an informational message which will be displayed in conjunction
	with various error messages if the object specified by the user was a
	synonym.

 System Status:
	No change is system status; informational only.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_PS0452_CANT_DROP_SYN:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - query
	%1c - synonym name

 Explanation:
	The user entered a "DROP synonym_name".  One must use "DROP SYNONYM"
	to drop the synonym or "DROP [TABLE|VIEW|INDEX]" to drop the object
	for which the synonym was defined.

 System Status:
	The synonym will not be dropped.  If there were other objects listed in
	the DROP statement, they will be processed in turn.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and reenter.


E_PS0453_SYN_ALREADY_EXISTS:SS42502_DUPL_OBJECT


 Parameters:
	%0c - query
	%0c - object name as specified by the user

 Explanation:
	The user tried to create a new object, but they already own a
	synonym by the same name.  This message is intended to be used
	in conjunction with QUEL queries: CREATE/DEFINE VIEW/RETRIEVE INTO.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user can give the new object a different name or use "DROP SYNONYM"
	(SQL) to destroy an existing synonym.


E_PS0454_CREATE_SYN_ERROR:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - synonym name

 Explanation:
	A "CREATE SYNONYM" query failed due to some internal error.

 System Status:
	Current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Contact the system administrator.


E_PS0455_CRT_SYN_ON_SYN:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - synonym name on which user tried to create a synonym

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to create a synonym on another synonym.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and continue.


E_PS0456_DROP_SYN_ERROR:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - synonym name

 Explanation:
	A "DROP SYNONYM" query failed due to some internal error.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Contact the system administrator.


E_PS0457_DROPSYN_NOT_SYN:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - object name as specified by the user
	%1c - object type
	%2c - query to be used to drop this object

 Explanation:
	The user entered "DROP SYNONYM obj_name", but "obj_name" does not
	refer to a synonym.

 System Status:
	If the user specified other synonyms to be dropped, they will be
	processed in turn.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and reenter.


E_PS0458_ULH_ALIAS_ERROR:SS50003_EXHAUSTED_RESOURCE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	RDF called ulh_define_alias(), and ULH returned E_UL0119_ALIAS_MEM.
	This situation would occur if there is too much concurrent activity
	and/or if the RDF startup parameters were poorly chosen.

	To correct this problem, one could rerun the query, anticipating
	that some of the concurrent activity has died down.  However, a more
	permanent solution would be to stop the server and restart it with a
	larger maximum number of tables and larger number of synonyms per table
	which can be specified in iirundbms.com_<node> using:

	    /rdf=(max_tbls=N1, tbl_synonyms=N2).

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Modify iirundbms.com_<node> RDF startup parameters, specifying larger
	numbers, then restart the server and try again.


E_PS0459_ILLEGAL_II_NAME:SS42507_RESERVED_IDENTIFIER


 Parameters:
	%0c - command name (CREATE SYNONYM or DBEVENT)
	%1c - object type (synonym or dbevent)
	%2c - invalid name
	%3c - the reserved system prefix

 Explanation:
	All objects beginning with the system prefix are reserved.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Use a different name, and retry the statement.


E_PS045F_WRONG_CASE:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - command name (CREATE TABLE or SYNONYM)
	%1c - invalid name
	%2c - the reserved system prefix

 Explanation:
	All objects beginning with the system prefix are reserved.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Use a name that is all upper-case (for FIPS database)
	or all lower-case (for lower-mixed database).


E_PS0460_DUP_UPD_COL:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - column name

 Explanation:
	In a "CREATE RULE" statement, the same column can be listed in the
	UPDATE(col_list) only once.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Change the statement to list the column only once and reenter.


E_PS0461_BAD_COL_REF_QUAL:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - <qualifier> found in a <column reference>;
	      may be of format <table name>, <correlation name>, or
	      <schema name>.<table name>

 Explanation:
	A <qualifier> found in a <column reference> did not identify any of the
	<table reference>s within whose scope the <column reference> appeared.
	
	A <column reference> found in a <target list> or <group by clause> of a
	query may only reference tables appearing in the <from list> (or
	equivalent) at the same scope.

	A <column reference> found outside of a <target list> or <group by
	clause> of a query may reference tables appearing in the <from list>
	(or equivalent) at the same scope or in outer subselects.

	A <column reference> in CHECK constraint found outside of subselects,
	must reference the table on which CHECK constraint is being defined.
	
 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the query and reenter.


E_PS0470_REFERENCES_ON_VIEW:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - view name

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to grant or revoke REFERENCES privilege on a view, 
	which is illegal.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Change the query and reenter.  Either REFERENCES must be removed from
	the privilege list or the offending view must be removed from the
	object list.


E_PS0471_CHECK_CONSTRAINT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement ("CREATE TABLE" or "ALTER TABLE")

 Explanation:
	A subselect or an aggregate function was encountered inside a CHECK
	constraint of a "CREATE TABLE" statement.  These constructs are
	explicitly disallowed inside a CHECK constraint.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and reenter.


E_PS0472_COL_CHECK_CONSTRAINT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement ("CREATE TABLE" or "ALTER TABLE")
	%1c - column name
	%2c - table name
	
 Explanation:
	A column CHECK constraint cannot reference any other columns.
	A reference to a column name different from the one for which
	the CHECK constraint is being defined has been found.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and reenter.


E_PS0473_TBL_CHECK_CONSTRAINT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement ("CREATE TABLE" or "ALTER TABLE")
	%1c - constraint type (CHECK, UNIQUE, or REFERENTIAL)
	%2c - table name
	%3c - nonexistent attribute name

 Explanation:
	A column used in a constraint definition does not exist in the
	table being created or altered.

	Note that, although CHECK constraints allow a boolean expression,
	in Entry Level SQL92 (and r6.5), they cannot access attributes of
	any other table.  This will be relaxed later for Intermediate SQL92.

	NOTE: UNIQUE also includes PRIMARY KEY constraints, so the
	      constraint could be a PRIMARY KEY constraint.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and reenter.


E_PS0474_CHECK_CONSTRAINT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement ("CREATE TABLE" or "ALTER TABLE")
	%1c - table name
	%2c - table attribute

 Explanation:
	A CHECK constraint may reference only the attributes of the table
	being created.  The user attempted to use an attribute of a table
	other than the one being created inside a CHECK constraint.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and reenter.


E_PS0475_CONSTRAINT_NOT_ALLOWED:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement (one of "CREATE PROCEDURE",
	      "DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE", or "REGISTER TABLE")

 Explanation:
	SQL92-style constraints are only allowed in the "CREATE TABLE"
	or "ALTER TABLE" statements.  They cannot be used for temporary
	tables, database procedures (parameters or local variables), or
	"REGISTER TABLE" or ALTER TABLE ..ALTER COLUMN statements.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the constraint clauses, and reenter the statement.


E_PS0476_USER_DEFAULT_NOTALLOWED:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement executed (one of:
	      "DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE" or "REGISTER TABLE")
 Explanation:
	User-defined defaults (i.e., [WITH] DEFAULT <values>) are only allowed
	in "CREATE TABLE", "ALTER TABLE", and "CREATE PROCEDURE" statements.
	They cannot be used for temporary tables, or "REGISTER TABLE"
	statements.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the user-defined default clauses, and reenter the statement.


E_PS0477_BAD_DEFAULTSYNTAX_SQL92:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement (one of "CREATE TABLE" or "CREATE PROCEDURE")

 Explanation:
	The user specified DEFAULT without the WITH keyword and without a
	value.  The WITH keyword is only optional if a value is specified.
	Thus, one or the other must be specified.

	Valid default syntax is one of:
	       WITH DEFAULT
	       [WITH] DEFAULT <value>
	       [WITH] DEFAULT USER
	       [WITH] DEFAULT NULL

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error, and reenter the statement.


E_PS0478_BAD_DEFAULT_SYNTAX:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement (such as "REGISTER TABLE",
	      "DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE", or "QUEL CREATE")

 Explanation:
	The user specified DEFAULT without the WITH keyword and without a
	value.  The WITH keyword is only optional if a value is specified.
	Thus, one or the other must be specified.

	Valid default syntax is one of
	       WITH DEFAULT
	       [WITH] DEFAULT <value>
	       [WITH] DEFAULT USER
	       [WITH] DEFAULT NULL

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error, and reenter the statement.


E_PS0479_DUP_COL_QUAL:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement executed (one of "CREATE TABLE",
	      "CREATE PROCEDURE", "DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE",
	      or "REGISTER TABLE")
	%1c - column name (parameter name if "CREATE PROCEDURE" statement)

 Explanation:
	Since column qualifications can be in any order now (as of r6.5),
	the syntax rules don't automatically catch conflicts.  This error
	was explicitly added to catch them instead. It occurs when a user
	specifies a statement such as:

	       C int NOT NULL UNIQUE NOT NULL
	or
	       C int WITH DEFAULT WITH NULL WITH DEFAULT 100

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the duplicate clause, and reenter the statement.


E_PS047A_CONFLICT_COL_QUAL:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement (one of "CREATE TABLE", "CREATE PROCEDURE",
	      "DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE", or "REGISTER TABLE")
	%1c - column name (parameter name if "CREATE PROCEDURE" statement)

 Explanation:
	Since column qualifications can be in any order now (as of r6.5),
	the syntax rules don't automatically catch conflicts.  This error
	was explicitly added to catch them instead. It occurs when a user
	specifies a statement such as:

	       C int NOT NULL UNIQUE WITH NULL
	or
	       C int WITH DEFAULT WITH NULL NOT DEFAULT

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the conflicting clause, and reenter the statement.


E_PS047B_RESERVED_IDENT:SS42506_INVALID_IDENTIFIER


 Parameters:
	%0c - command name
	%1c - object name

 Explanation:
	The DBMS must generate names for CONSTRAINTS and other objects.
	To make sure that these names do not conflict with user names,
	we start these names with a dollar sign ("$") and reserve all
	names starting with a dollar sign for internal use.
	Thus, users cannot create an object name starting with a dollar
	sign, even within delimited identifiers.

	Users can, however, use names starting with "$" in non-create
	commands, such as "DROP INDEX" or "ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT".

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error, and reenter the statement.


E_PS047C_DUP_CONS_NAME:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement (either "CREATE TABLE" or "ALTER TABLE")
	%1c - constraint name

 Explanation:
	Constraint names must be unique within a user's entire schema,
	not just within a single table.

	This error is returned if a constraint of the same name already
	exists in the database, or if the user specified the same name for
	two constraints in a single "CREATE TABLE" statement.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the duplicate clause, and reenter the statement.


E_PS047D_2UNIQUE_CONS_CONFLICT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement executed (either "CREATE TABLE" or "ALTER TABLE")
	%1c - first UNIQUE constraint name
	%2c - second UNIQUE constraint name

 Explanation:
	The set of columns in a UNIQUE constraint must be distinct from the
	set of columns in every other UNIQUE constraint. That is, the set
	of columns in one constraint cannot be exactly the same as the set of
	columns in the other constraint.

	NOTE: UNIQUE also includes PRIMARY KEY constraints, so one of the
	      constraints could be a PRIMARY KEY constraint.

	This error is returned if both of the constraints have names.
	If neither or only one has a name, following errors are used.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Remove one of the constraint clauses or change the set of columns,
	and reenter the statement.


E_PS047E_1UNIQUE_CONS_CONFLICT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement (either "CREATE TABLE" or "ALTER TABLE")
	%1c - UNIQUE constraint name

 Explanation:
	The set of columns in a UNIQUE constraint must be distinct from the
	set of columns in every other UNIQUE constraint. That is, the set of
	columns in one constraint cannot be exactly the same as the set of
	columns in the other constraint.

	NOTE: UNIQUE also includes PRIMARY KEY constraints, so one of the
	      constraints could be a PRIMARY KEY constraint.

	This error is returned if only one of the constraints has a name.
	If neither or both have a name, following errors are used.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Remove one of the constraint clauses or change the set of columns,
	and reenter the statement.


E_PS047F_0UNIQUE_CONS_CONFLICT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement (either "CREATE TABLE" or "ALTER TABLE")

 Explanation:
	The set of columns in a UNIQUE constraint must be distinct from the
	set of columns in every other UNIQUE constraint. That is, the set of
	columns in one constraint cannot be exactly the same as the set of
	columns in the other constraint.

	NOTE: UNIQUE also includes PRIMARY KEY constraints, so one of the
	      constraints could be a PRIMARY KEY constraint.

	This error is returned if neither of the constraints has a name.
	If one or both have a name, above errors are used.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Remove one of the constraint clauses or change the set of columns,
	and reenter the statement.


E_PS0480_UNIQUE_NOT_NULL:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement (either "CREATE TABLE" or "ALTER TABLE")
	%1c - table name

 Explanation:
	For Entry Level SQL92, all columns in a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY
	constraint must specify "NOT NULL" in the column definition.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	If a "CREATE TABLE" statement was used, add a "NOT NULL" specification
	to the column definition of all columns in the UNIQUE constraint, and
	reenter the statement.

	If an "ALTER TABLE" statement was used, it cannot use "WITH NULL"
	columns in a UNIQUE constraint; the table must be dropped and
	recreated with those columns "NOT NULL".


E_PS0481_CONS_DUP_COL:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement ("CREATE TABLE" or "ALTER TABLE")
	%1c - column name
	%2c - constraint type (CHECK, UNIQUE, or REFERENTIAL)

 Explanation:
	A column name was listed twice in the same constraint.  In a
	REFERENTIAL constraint, the duplicate could be in either the
	referencing column list or the referenced column list.

	NOTE: UNIQUE also includes PRIMARY KEY constraints, so the
	      constraint could be a PRIMARY KEY constraint.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the duplicate column name, and reenter the statement.


E_PS0482_2CONS_DUP_COL:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement (either "CREATE TABLE" or "ALTER TABLE")
	%1c - column name
	%2c - constraint type (CHECK,UNIQUE,REFERENTIAL)
	%3c - constraint name

 Explanation:
	A column name was listed twice in the same constraint.  In a
	REFERENTIAL constraint, the duplicate could be in either the
	referencing column list or the referenced column list.

	NOTE: UNIQUE also includes PRIMARY KEY constraints, so the
	      constraint could be a PRIMARY KEY constraint.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the duplicate column name, and reenter the statement.


E_PS0483_CONS_NO_COL:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement (either "CREATE TABLE" or "ALTER TABLE")
	%1c - column name
	%2c - constraint type (CHECK, UNIQUE, or REFERENTIAL)

 Explanation:
	A column name listed in a constraint does not exist. In a REFERENTIAL
	constraint, the duplicate could be in either the referencing column
	list or the referenced column list.

	NOTE: UNIQUE also includes PRIMARY KEY constraints, so the
	      constraint could be a PRIMARY KEY constraint.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the error, and reenter the statement.


E_PS0484_REF_NUM_COL:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - executed statement (either "CREATE TABLE" or "ALTER TABLE")
	%1c - table name

 Explanation:
	The number of referencing columns has to be the same as the number
	of referenced columns.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Reenter the statement with the correct list of column names.


E_PS0485_REF_TYPE_RES:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - referencing column name
	%1c - referenced column name

 Explanation:
	The datatype of each referencing column must match the datatype of
	its corresponding referenced column.

	Since we have defined "match" to be the same as "joinable," and
	the DBMS can join almost any type to any other type, most types will
	match.  The main ones that don't are:

	             date and money
	             date and float
	             date and integer

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	The user can reenter the statement with a different list of column
	names, or they may have to drop and redefine the tables.


E_PS0486_INVALID_CONS_TYPE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This error means an unexpected constraint type was found in
	internal data structures.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

      The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the statement and reenter.


E_PS048D_CONS_BADINDEX:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - name of an index

 Explanation:
	A constraint definition explicitly specified the name of an 
	existing index, several constraints in the same table definition
	specified the same index name or the constraint specified the
	WITH INDEX = BASE TABLE STRUCTURE option, and the column lists 
	of the constraints and the key structure of the corresponding 
	index were incompatible. See documentation for more details. 

 System Status:
      The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the statement and reenter.


E_PS048E_CONS_NOINDEX:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	none.

 Explanation:
	The definition of a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint included
	the WITH NO INDEX option. It is only permitted on referential
	constraints.

 System Status:
      The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the statement and reenter.


E_PS048F_CONS_NOBASE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	none.

 Explanation:
	An ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT statement specified the 
	WITH INDEX = BASE TABLE STRUCTURE option, but the table has
	no defined structure. Before this option is permitted, the 
	table must be modified to an appropriate structure on the
	constrained columns.

 System Status:
      The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the statement and reenter.


E_PS0490_NO_UNIQUE_CONSTRAINT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table referenced in the FOREIGN KEY constraint.

 Explanation:
	The columns specified in the REFERENCED clause of a FOREIGN
	KEY constraint must form a unique constraint in the REFERENCED
	table.  (Note that a primary key is a unique constraint). The
	REFERENCED column list is the second list of columns in the
	foreign key specification.

	The DBMS looks for a unique constraint on the referenced table
	containing exactly the list of columns specified in the
	FOREIGN KEY constraint; if no matching constraint is found,
	this error is returned.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Find the unique constraint on the referenced table desired
	for the referential constraint, and specify the columns exactly.
	If no unique constraint exists on the columns desired, it may be
	possible to create one.


E_PS0491_NO_PRIMARY_KEY:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name

 Explanation:
	If the user does not specify a referenced column list in a
	foreign key constraint, SQL92 says we must look for a primary key
	on the referenced table to use as the referenced columns. If no
	primary key is found, this error is returned.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Find the unique constraint on the referenced table desired for the
	referential constraint, and specify the columns explicitly.  If no
	primary key constraint exists on the columns desired, it may be
	possible to create one.


E_PS0492_CHECK_CONS_TYPE_ERROR:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name

 Explanation:
	This error occurs if an expression in a CHECK condition involves
	conflicting datatypes.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the conflicting expression and try again.


E_PS0493_DUPL_PRIMARY_KEY:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name

 Explanation:
	SQL92 says there can be only one primary key on a table.
	If the user tries to specify another primary key on a table
	that already has one, this error is returned.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the primary key constraint, or change it to a plain
	unique constraint.


E_PS0494_CONS_NAME:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - constraint name

 Explanation:
	If a constraint that is being created contains a syntax or
	other error, and that constraint was given a name by the user,
	this message will print out the constraint name. This is extra
	information for the user, not a second error.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	See error message E_PS0493.


E_PS0495_DUPL_CONS_NAME:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - constraint name
	%01 - schema name

 Explanation:
	SQL92 says that constraint names must be unique within a schema.
	This means that two tables in the same schema cannot have
	constraints with the same name.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Choose a different name for the constraint and try again.


E_PS0496_CANT_ALTER_VIEW:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - view name

 Explanation:
	An "ALTER TABLE" statement can only be used on tables, not views. 

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Specify a different table name (one that is not a view).


E_PS0497_CONS_IXOPTS:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	none

 Explanation:
	If an "ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ..." uses the
	WITH INDEX = <index name> or BASE TABLE STRUCTURE option,
	the index or base table structure must have the PERSISTENCE and
	UNIQUE_SCOPE = STATEMENT (for unique constraints, only) 
	attributes.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	If the required options are acceptable, they may be added
	with "MODIFY table/index WITH PERSISTENCE, UNIQUE_SCOPE =
	STATEMENT", and the constraint definition can be re-executed.


E_PS0498_DEFAULT_USER_SIZE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - column name
	%1d - minimum size required (DB_MAXNAME)

 Explanation:
	A column that has a user function as a default must be
	large enough to hold the maximum-sized user name. The
	maximum size is DB_MAXNAME.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Try the query again, giving a larger size for the column.


E_PS0499_BAD_DEFAULT_VALUE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - column name

 Explanation:
	The default value for a column must be of the same
	datatype as the column itself.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Try the query again with a default value of the correct type.


E_PS049A_BAD_DEFAULT_SIZE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - column name

 Explanation:
	SQL92 says the default value for a column must fit into the
	datatype the column is defined with. For example, "col1 i1 default 500"
	is not valid because the range of an i1 is -128 to 127.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Try the query again with a default value within the correct
	range, length, or precision of the datatype.


E_PS049B_BAD_DEFAULT_FUNC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - column name

 Explanation:
	SQL92 says the default value for a column must fit into the
	datatype the column is defined with. For example, "col1 i1 default 500"
	is not valid because the range of an i1 is -128 to 127.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Try the query again with a default value within the correct
	range, length, or precision of the datatype.


E_PS049C_NO_DEFAULT_FROM_RDF:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name

 Explanation:
	This is an internal error. This error occurs when the default ID for
	a column in the iiattribute catalog cannot be found in the iidefault
	catalog.
	
 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your Ingres Corporation Technical Support representative.


E_PS049D_RDF_CANT_READ_DEF:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name

 Explanation:
	This is an internal error. This error occurs when the default ID for
	a column in the iiattribute catalog cannot be found in the iidefault
	catalog.
	
 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your Ingres Corporation Technical Support representative.


E_PS049E_CANT_EXEC_SYSGEN_PROC:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - system-generated procedure name

 Explanation:
	System-generated procedures can only be executed by system-generated
	rules.  Users cannot execute them.

	These rules and procedure are used internally to implement complex
	features such as SQL92 CHECK and REFERENTIAL constraints or
	WITH CHECK OPTION for views.
	
 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Do not attempt to execute system-generated procedures.


E_PS049F_NO_PERIPH_DEFAULT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - column name
	%1c - datatype name

 Explanation:
	Defaults are not allowed on large objects (e.g. blobs).
	The user must either specify NOT DEFAULT or specify nothing (which
	gives an implicit NULL default).

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Change the DEFAULT specification to NOT DEFAULT,
	or remove it entirely (to get a NULL default).


E_PS04A0_DEFAULT_TOO_LONG:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - column name of column in error
	%1c - maximum size of a default (1500 bytes in 6.5)

 Explanation:
	The system catalog for storing default values
	has a fixed maximum size.  A default that is longer than
	that size cannot be declared, as it cannot be stored.

	Note that character-string defaults must be stored with
	surrounding single quotes, so that the maximum character
	default is actually two bytes less than the maximum
	non-character default (i.e., 1498 bytes in 6.5).

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Pick a default of a shorter length, or leave the default
	value off the "CREATE TABLE" statement.


E_PS04A1_NO_REF_PRIV:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - schema name

 Explanation:
	In order to create a referential constraint in which the referenced
	table (sometimes called the primary key table) is owned by another
	user, that table must exist and the current user must have REFERENCES 
	privilege on the columns used in the referential constraint.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Have the owner of the table grant you REFERENCES privilege,
	if possible; otherwise, remove the referential constraint clause
	from the statement (if the statement was a "CREATE TABLE").


E_PS04A2_NO_REF_VIEW:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - view name

 Explanation:
	REFERENTIAL constraints can only refer to base tables (or synonyms),
	not to views. 

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Replace the name of the view with the name of a base table.


E_PS04A3_NO_GRANT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - procedure name

 Explanation:
	SQL92 constraints and views WITH CHECK OPTION create internal
	procedures on behalf of the user.  These procedures are only
	executed when called by RULES, and then all users can execute them.
	But users cannot GRANT or REVOKE execute on these procedures.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Do not attempt to GRANT or REVOKE privileges on this procedure.


E_PS04A4_INT_ERROR:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement name
	%1c - column name

 Explanation:
	A DECIMAL default value is converted to a FLOAT to check
	whether it is a zero default.  If this conversion fails,
	this error is returned.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Try the query again; look in the error log for other errors that
	may have caused this error.


E_PS04A5_NO_COLUMNS:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name

 Explanation:
	The user did not specify any columns when defining a table.
	This used to cause a syntax error.
	
	Since we have added ANSI-style constraints, "CREATE TABLE" follows
	ANSI-style syntax.  This syntax no longer prevents a user from
	specifying a table definition without any column definitions.
	So now we have to explicitly check this and return this error,
	instead of relying on the grammar to automatically return a
	syntax error. 

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Include columns in the table definition, and resubmit the query.


E_PS04A6_UDT_NO_LONGTXT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement name
	%1c - user-defined datatype (UDT)
	%2c - UDT column name

 Explanation:
	In 6.5, defaults are manipulated internally in longtext format,
	which is in the same format as varchar, but with different semantics.
	In order to use defaults on a UDT column, there must be a way
	to convert the UDT value to and from longtext.  Users building a
	UDT are required to supply longtext conversion functions, but this
	is not strictly enforced, so it is possible to have a working UDT
	that does not have a longtext conversion function.

	In order for defaults and UDTs to work together in 6.5, the user
	must define and supply conversion functions for UDT -> longtext
	and longtext -> UDT.
	
 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Add required conversion functions to the UDT definition, recompile it
	and relink it into the server, then retry the command.


E_PS04A7_UDT_NO_GETEMPTY:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement name
	%1c - user-defined datatype (UDT)
	%2c - UDT column name

 Explanation:
	When a column is defined using WITH DEFAULT, the DBMS puts an
	"empty" value into that column if the user doesn't specify a value
	on an INSERT statement. In order to use "WITH DEFAULT" on a UDT column,
	there must be a "getempty" function defined for that UDT, which the
	DBMS uses to get the value to put into that column for its default.

	This error occurs when either the "getempty" routine for a UDT
	wasn't found by ADF, or if the routine itself has a coding error.
	
 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Add the required "getempty" function to the UDT definition, recompile
	it and relink it into the server, then retry the command.


E_PS04A8_UDT_LTXT_CONVERSION:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement name
	%1c - user-defined datatype (UDT)
	%2c - UDT column name

 Explanation:
	In 6.5, defaults are manipulated internally in longtext format,
	which is in the same format as varchar, but with different semantics.
	In order to use defaults on a UDT column, there must be a way
	to convert the UDT value to and from longtext.  Users building a
	UDT are required to supply longtext conversion functions, but this
	is not strictly enforced, so it is possible to have a working UDT
	that does not have a longtext conversion function.

	In order for defaults and UDTs to work together in 6.5, the user
	must define and supply conversion functions for UDT -> longtext
	and longtext -> UDT.
	
 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Debug UDT conversion functions, recompile the UDT definition and
	relink it into the server, then retry the command.
	
	If no problems can be found in the conversion functions, contact 
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support. Save the error log file for
	analysis by Technical Support personnel.


E_PS04A9_NON_JOUR_REFING_JOUR_DB:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - name of referencing table
	%1c - schema to which the referencing table belongs

 Explanation:
	In order to ensure that ROLLFORWARDDB processing does not result in
	data in a table no longer satisfying  referential constraints defined 
	on it, we must prevent user from creating a referential constraint on a 
	table whose data is not being journaled in a database which is being 
	journaled.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	If the table exists and has journaling disabled, you need to 
	SET JOURNALING on that table.  You also need to checkpoint the database
	to enable journaling on that table.  Only then you may be allowed to
	define a referential constraint on this table.
 	If this is a new table, remove NOJOURNALING from its WITH-clause and 
	reissue the statement.


E_PS04AA_NON_JOUR_REFD_JOUR_DB:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - name of referencing table
	%1c - schema to which the referencing table belongs
	%2c - name of referenced table
	%3c - schema to which the referenced table belongs

 Explanation:
	In order to ensure that ROLLFORWARDDB processing does not result in
	data in a table no longer satisfying  referential constraints defined 
	on it, we must prevent user from creating a referential constraint 
	referencing a table whose data is not being journaled in a database 
	which is being journaled.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	If the table exists and has journaling disabled, you need to 
	SET JOURNALING on that table.  You also need to checkpoint the database
	to enable journaling on that table.  Only then you may be allowed to
	define a referential constraint on this table.


E_PS04AB_REF_CONS_JOUR_MISMATCH:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - name of referencing table
	%1c - schema to which the referencing table belongs
	%2c - name of referenced table
	%3c - schema to which the referenced table belongs

 Explanation:
	In order to ensure that ROLLFORWARDDB processing does not result in
	data in a table no longer satisfying  referential constraints defined 
	on it, we must prevent user from creating a referential constraint 
	in a database which is not being journaled between two tables one of 
	which has journaling disabled while the other may have it enabled after
	the next checkpoint 

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure that both referencing and referenced tables have the same 
	journaling status.  Journaling status of existing tables can be altered
	by issuing SET [NO]JOURNALING ON <table>.  If the referencing table is 
	being created, its journaling status can be influenced by specifying 
	WITH [NO]JOURNALING.


E_PS04AC_CONS_NON_JOR_TBL_JOR_DB:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - type of constraint; one of CHECK, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY
	%1c - name of referencing table
	%2c - schema to which the referencing table belongs

 Explanation:
	In order to ensure that ROLLFORWARDDB processing does not result in
	data in a table no longer satisfying  CHECK, UNIQUE, or PRIMARY KEY
	constraints defined on it, we must prevent user from creating a CHECK, 
	UNIQUE, or PRIMARY KEY constraint on a table whose data is not being 
	journaled in a database which is being journaled.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	You need to SET JOURNALING on the table and to checkpoint the database
	to enable journaling on that table.  Only then you may be allowed to
	define a constraint on it.


W_PS04AD_NON_JOUR_REFING_JOUR_DB:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
	%0c - name of referencing table
	%1c - schema to which the referencing table belongs

 Explanation:
	In order to ensure that ROLLFORWARDDB processing does not result in
	data in a table no longer satisfying  referential constraints defined 
	on it, we must prevent user from creating a referential constraint on a 
	table whose data is not being journaled in a database which is being 
	journaled.  

	User has overridden this restriction by specifying WITH NOJOURNAL_CHECK.
	User must be aware that if ROLLFORWARDDB is used on this database before
	the next checkpoint is taken, it may end up in a state where data in the
	referencing table will not satisfy the constraint added by this 
	statement.

 System Status:
	This is just a warning which will be sent to the error log file; 
	the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	We strongly discourage users from overriding restrictions linking 
	ability to define constraints on tables with journaling status of the 
	database and the table(s) involved in the constraint.  Users resorting 
	to specifying WITH NOJOURNAL_CHECK should try to checkpoint the database
	as soon as possible after adding this constraint in order to avoid a 
	situation where use of ROLLFORWARDDB may render data in the table no 
	longer satisfying the constraint defined by this statement.


W_PS04AE_NON_JOUR_REFD_JOUR_DB:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
	%0c - name of referencing table

W_PS04B0_CONS_NON_JOR_TBL_JOR_DB:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
	%0c - type of constraint; one of CHECK, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY
	%1c - name of referencing table
	%2c - schema to which the referencing table belongs

 Explanation:
	In order to ensure that ROLLFORWARDDB processing does not result in

E_PS04B1_SET_JOUR_ON_REF_TBL:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c -	name of a table
	%1c -	name of the schema to which the table belongs

 Explanation:
	User attempted to issue SET [NO]JOURNALING statement against a table
	which is involved in a REFERENCES constraint.  Alteration of journaling 
	status of tables involved in REFERENCES constraint(s) is expressly 
	proscribed since subsequent use of ROLLFORWARDDB may result in data in 
	the table violating REFERENCES constraint(s) defined on it

 System Status:
      The program continues; the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Avoid trying to alter journaling status of tables involved in 
	REFERENCES constraint(s).


E_PS04B2_CONS_REFOPTS:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	none

 Explanation:
	If a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement defines a 
	referential constraint which includes referential actions
	(ON DELETE, ON UPDATE clauses), at most one of each of
	ON DELETE and ON UPDATE may be specified. This statement 
	included two or more ON UPDATE and/or ON DELETE clauses for
	the same referential relationship definition.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Select the proper combination of referential actions and
	retry the statement.


E_PS04B3_BAD_SEQOP_DEFAULT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - The invalid default string

 Explanation:
	The default value retrieved from the system catalogs started out
	to be a sequence default ("next value for ..."), but the remainder
	was malformed.  This could be caused by an internal error, or by
	an administrator manually changing the defaults catalog.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Reverse the manual change, if any;  else report this error

	%0c - view name

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to create a view with the "WITH CHECK OPTION"
	clause, even though the outermost subselect of the definition of
	its underlying view contains a <having clause>.  Such views are not
	updatable, and allowing the "WITH CHECK OPTION" clause for them
	violates ANSI SQL92.

 System Status:
	The view will be created with the "WITHOUT CHECK OPTION" clause.

 Recommendation:
	None.


W_PS058B_WCO_AND_SET_FUNCS_IN_UV:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
	%0c - view name

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to create a view with the "WITH CHECK OPTION"
	clause, even though the outermost subselect of the definition of its
	underlying view contains a <set function> (e.g., COUNT, SUM, etc.).
	Such views are not updatable, and allowing the "WITH CHECK OPTION"
	clause for them violates ANSI SQL92.

 System Status:
	The view will be created with the "WITHOUT CHECK OPTION" clause.

 Recommendation:
	None.


W_PS058C_WCO_AND_LUT_IN_WHERE_CLAUSE:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
	%0c - view name

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to create a view with the "WITH CHECK OPTION"
	clause, even though the base table on which a view is defined is
	also involved in the WHERE-clause of the view definition. In SQL92,
	this is the case where the <table expression> immediately contained
	in the <query specification> (QS) of <view definition> contains a
	<where clause> (WC), and the leaf generally underlying table of the
	QS is a generally underlying table of some <query expression>
	contained in the WC.

	Such views are not updatable under SQL92 rules, but are updatable under
	extended SQL rules. However, the "WITH CHECK OPTION" clause should not
	be specified for such views.

 System Status:
	The view will be created with the "WITHOUT CHECK OPTION" clause.

 Recommendation:
	N/A


W_PS058D_WCO_AND_NO_UPDATABLE_COLS:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
	%0c - view name

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to create a view with the "WITH CHECK OPTION"
	clause, even though none of its columns are updatable.  The extended SQL
	definition of what constitutes an updatable view is much looser than
	the SQL92 definition, but we need to set the limit somewhere.

 System Status:
	The view will be created with the "WITHOUT CHECK OPTION" clause.

 Recommendation:
	None.


W_PS058F_WCO_AND_UNSPEC_REASON:SS01000_WARNING


 Parameters:
	%0c - view name

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to create a view with the "WITH CHECK OPTION"
	clause, even though the view is non-updatable.  This message will
	be produced only if a new criterion has been added to the list of
	those that would render a view non-updatable, but the DBMS code
	responsible for producing the message has not been appropriately
	modified.

 System Status:
	The view will be created with the "WITHOUT CHECK OPTION" clause.

 Recommendation:
	Notify your Ingres Corporation Technical Support representative.


E_PS0590_UNION_IN_RULE_VIEW:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:

	Such views are not updatable, and rules cannot be specified for
	non-updatable views.

 System Status:
	The statement will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement and reenter.


E_PS0593_GROUP_BY_IN_RULE_VIEW:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - view name

E_PS0BB0_UNIQ_SCOPE_NOT_ALLOWED:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - entered statement

 Explanation:
	UNIQUE_SCOPE is only valid with a UNIQUE index or table order,
	and UNIQUE can only be specified via the "CREATE INDEX" or
	"MODIFY" commands.  Commands such as "CREATE TABLE", "DECLARE TEMP
	TABLE", and "CREATE TABLE .. AS SELECT" will return this error.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Re-issue the statement without the UNIQUE_SCOPE option.


E_PS0BB1_UNIQ_SCOPE_SQL_ONLY:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - entered statement

 Explanation:
	UNIQUE_SCOPE is only allowed in SQL, not QUEL.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Re-issue the statement without the UNIQUE_SCOPE option,
	or re-issue the statement using SQL "CREATE INDEX".


E_PS0BB2_UNIQUE_REQUIRED:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - entered statement

 Explanation:
	UNIQUE_SCOPE is only valid on a unique index or storage
	structure.  The statement must specify the UNIQUE
	option in order to specify the UNIQUE_SCOPE option.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Re-issue the statement, adding the UNIQUE option,
	or re-issue the statement without the UNIQUE_SCOPE option.


E_PS0BB3_INVALID_UNIQUE_SCOPE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - entered statement
	%1c - valid value

 Explanation:
	UNIQUE_SCOPE has only two valid values: "statement" and "row".
	The user specified some other string value instead.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Re-issue the statement, specifying either "statement" or "row".


E_PS0BB4_CANT_CHANGE_UNIQUE_CONS:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - entered statement
	%1c - "index" or "table"
	%2c - table or index name

 Explanation:
	Some UNIQUE indexes are created by the system to implement SQL92
	UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints. Users can modify these indexes,
	as necessary, to change their characteristics (e.g., from Btree to
	ISAM), or to reorganize the index.  However, users cannot change the
	UNIQUEness attributes or the PERSISTENCE of the index, as that could
	cause the constraint to be violated.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Add the missing keywords and WITH options, and re-issue the statement.


E_PS0BB5_NO_PERSIST_TABLE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - entered statement (MODIFY)
	%1c - table name

 Explanation:
	PERSISTENCE means that an index still exists after its base
	table has been modified.  The index is automatically recreated
	after the MODIFY finishes. Thus, this concept does not make sense
	for base tables, and the [NO]PERSISTENCE option is not allowed for
	base tables, only for indexes.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the [NO]PERSISTENCE clause from the statement and reenter.


E_PS0BB6_PERSISTENT_CONSTRAINT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - entered statement
	%1c - "index" or "table"
	%2c - table or index name

 Explanation:
	Some indexes are created by the system to implement SQL92
	FOREIGN KEY constraints. Users can modify these indexes,
	as necessary, to change their characteristics (e.g., from Btree to
	ISAM), or to reorganize the index.  However, users cannot change the
	PERSISTENCE of the index, as that could cause the constraint to be 
      violated.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:


E_PS0BC0_BTREE_INDEX_NO_DCOMP:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement executed (either MODIFY or CREATE INDEX)
	%1c - table name

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when a "MODIFY" or "CREATE INDEX" statement
	requests that a secondary index is to be modified to a Btree
	storage structure and also requests that data compression is
	to be used. This is illegal, since Btree secondary indexes
	do not support data compression.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement (either do not request data compression or choose
	another storage structure) and re-issue the statement.


E_PS0BC1_KCOMP_BTREE_ONLY:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name
	%1c - compression option name

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when a "CREATE TABLE", "MODIFY", or "CREATE
	INDEX" statement requests that KEY compression be used, but the storage
	structure in question is not a Btree storage structure.

	Currently, only the Btree storage structure supports KEY compression.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement (either do not request KEY compression or specify
	the Btree storage structure) and re-issue the statement.


E_PS0BC2_COMP_NOT_ALLOWED:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when a "MODIFY TO MERGE", "MODIFY TO TRUNCATED",
	or "MODIFY TO REORGANIZE" statement specifies the "WITH COMPRESSION"
	clause. This clause is not valid on these special-purpose forms of the
	"MODIFY" statement.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the "WITH COMPRESSION" clause, and re-issue the statement.


E_PS0BC3_COMP_NOT_IN_RELOC:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0d - line number

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when a "MODIFY TO RELOCATE" statement
	specifies the "WITH COMPRESSION" clause. This clause is not valid
	on this special-purpose form of the "MODIFY" statement.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the "WITH COMPRESSION" clause, and re-issue the statement.


E_PS0BC4_COMPRESSION_TWICE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement name ("MODIFY", "CREATE INDEX", etc.)
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when a "MODIFY", "CREATE INDEX", or
	"CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT" statement specifies compression
	options more than once. Compression options may be specified
	using the "WITH COMPRESSION" clause, or they may be specified
	using a "C" in front of the storage structure name (e.g., "CISAM"),
	but the compression options may only be specified *once in the
	statement.

	You may not provide the "WITH COMPRESSION" clause more than once in a
	given statement, nor may you use the "WITH COMPRESSION" clause if you
	have also used a "C" in front of the storage structure name.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the extra compression options, and re-issue the statement.


E_PS0BC5_KEY_OR_DATA_ONLY:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement name ("MODIFY", "CREATE INDEX", etc.)
	%1d - line number
	%2c - invalid value

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when a "MODIFY", "CREATE INDEX", or
	"CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT" statement specifies an invalid
	keyword in the "WITH COMPRESSION=" clause.

	The only valid words in the "COMPRESSION=" clause are "KEY", "NOKEY",
	"DATA", or "NODATA".

	NODEPENDENCY_CHECK is only valid for a MODIFY statement.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Correct any typographical errors and remove any invalid keywords,
	then re-issue the statement.


E_PS0BC6_BAD_COMP_CLAUSE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement name ("MODIFY", "CREATE INDEX", etc.)
	%1d - line number
	%2c - invalid value

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when a "MODIFY", "CREATE INDEX", or
	"CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT" statement specifies an invalid
	single-keyword option.  The WITH clause must specify one of
	[NO]COMPRESSION, NOPARTITION, or [NO]PERSISTENCE, instead of
	the value printed in the message.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the WITH clause, and re-issue the statement.


E_PS0BC7_NO_STRUCTURE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0d - line number

 Explanation:
	This message is logged when an internal error is encountered in the
	parser. The error is that parsing of the "WITH COMPRESSION" clause was
	halted, because no storage structure could be found for the table or
	index being modified. The storage structure must be known in order for
	the parsing to be successfully completed, so the statement is rejected.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Please report this error to Ingres Corporation Technical Support. 
	Save the error log file for analysis by Technical Support personnel. If
	possible, determine the "MODIFY" statement which caused the error --
	this information will be valuable for diagnosing the problem.


E_PS0BC8_COMP_NO_STRUCTURE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement name ("CREATE INDEX" or "CREATE TABLE")
	%1d - line number

 Explanation:
	The "WITH COMPRESSION" clause on the "CREATE INDEX" and
	"CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT" statements can only be provided
	if the "STRUCTURE=" clause is also provided.

	This restriction exists because the meaning of the COMPRESSION clause
	depends on the storage structure of the table or index. Some storage
	structures, such as HASH and HEAP, do not support KEY compression.
	Other storage structures, such as a Btree secondary index, do not
	support DATA compression. Therefore, the desired storage structure
	must be specified in order to clarify the meaning of the COMPRESSION
	options.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Add the "STRUCTURE=" clause to the statement and re-issue.


E_PS0BC9_DUPLICATE_WITH_CLAUSE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement name ("MODIFY", "CREATE INDEX", etc.)
	%1d - line number
	%2c - WITH clause that is being rejected

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when a "MODIFY", "CREATE INDEX", or
	"CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT" statement specifies a particular
	WITH clause more than once.

	Each WITH clause in the statement should be specified at most once.

	Compression options may be specified using the "WITH COMPRESSION"
	clause, or they may be specified using a "C" in front of the storage
	structure name (e.g., "CISAM"), but the compression options may only
	be specified once in the statement.

	You may not provide the "WITH COMPRESSION" clause more than once in a
	given statement, nor may you use the "WITH COMPRESSION" clause if you
	have also used a "C" in front of the storage structure name.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the extra WITH clause options, and re-issue the statement.


E_PS0BCA_RTREE_INDEX_NO_COMP:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement executed (CREATE INDEX)
	%1c - table name

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when a "CREATE INDEX" statement
	requests that a secondary index is a Rtree storage structure
	and also requests that data compression is to be used.
	This is illegal, since Rtree indexes do not support compression.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement (either do not request data compression or choose
	another storage structure) and re-issue the statement.


E_PS0BCB_RTREE_INDEX_NO_UNIQUE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement executed (CREATE INDEX)
	%1c - table name

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when a "CREATE INDEX" statement
	requests that a secondary index is a Rtree storage structure
	and also requests that UNIQUE keys are to be used.
	This is illegal, since Rtree indexes do not support unique keys.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement (either do not request unique keys or choose
	another storage structure) and re-issue the statement.


E_PS0BCC_RTREE_INDEX_ONE_KEY:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR

	%0c - statement executed (CREATE INDEX)
	%1c - table name

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when a "CREATE INDEX" statement
	requests that a secondary index is a Rtree storage structure
	and also requests that the key is to be created from more than
	one column.  This is illegal, since Rtree indexes
	only support a single column as key.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement (either do not request multiple columns or choose
	another storage structure) and re-issue the statement.


E_PS0BCD_RTREE_INDEX_NEED_RANGE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement executed (CREATE INDEX)
	%1c - table name

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when a "CREATE INDEX" statement
	requests that a secondary index is a Rtree storage structure
	and has omitted the range specification.  An Rtree index
	requires a range specification.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement by adding the range of the key field
	and re-issue the statement.


E_PS0BCE_RTREE_INDEX_BAD_KEY:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement executed (CREATE INDEX)
	%1c - table name

 Explanation:
	This message is issued when a "CREATE INDEX" statement
	requests that a secondary index is a Rtree storage structure
	and specifies a key that is not supported by the spatial function
	"nbr".  The column must be supported by the "nbr" function for
      an Rtree secondary index.

 System Status:
	The statement is rejected.

 Recommendation:
      Pick a spatial datatype for the rtree secondary index key
	and re-issue the statement.

E_PS0C05_BAD_ADF_STATUS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_PS0C06_BAD_STMT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	When reconstructing the rule statement tree from internal data
	structures, an invalid relationship between statement nodes was found.

 System Status:
	The program continues; the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	If this is a Dynamic SQL statement, try to re-PREPARE the statement;
	otherwise, if this statement has a rule associated with it, your rule
	definition may have been corrupted.  Contact your system
	administrator and request that they save the current "rule row" in
	iirule, together with the associated objects in iitree and iiqrytext.
	Recreate the rule and try again.


E_PS0C80_NO_DEFLT_ON_DT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - datatype of value passed to decimal() conversion function

 Explanation:
	Currently, only float, integer, decimal, and money datatypes are
	assigned default precision and scale values when using the decimal()
	conversion function.  Receiving this error means that a value with
	some other datatype was passed as the first parameter of the decimal()
	function with the precision or scale omitted.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the usage of the decimal() conversion function by either
	changing the datatype of the first parameter to a type that provides
	default values for precision and scale, or explicitly provide precision
	and scale values in your decimal() function call.


E_PS0C81_MUST_BE_CONST:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The second and third arguments to the decimal() conversion function
	must be constants.  You are not allowed to use a column name from a
	table, a host variable (regardless of its storage class in the host
	language), repeat query parameters, or expressions of any kind.  For
	example, decimal(123, 10, 2) is legal while decimal(123, 8+2, 2) is
	illegal.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the usage of the decimal() conversion function by using only
	smallint constants for the precision and scale arguments to the
	function.


E_PS0C82_BAD_PRECISION:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The precision specified as the second parameter to the decimal()
	conversion function was either not a smallint literal, or was outside
	the legal range (1 <= precision <= 39).  You may not specify any type
	other than smallint; integer, decimal, and float literals are illegal.
	For example, decimal(123, 10, 2) is legal, but decimal(123, 10.0, 2)
	is illegal.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Change the usage of the decimal() conversion function to conform to
	the rules stated above.


E_PS0C83_BAD_SCALE:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	%0d - precision given in this decimal() function invocation

 Explanation:
	The scale specified as the third parameter to the decimal()
	conversion function was either not a smallint literal, or was
	outside the legal range (1 <= scale <= precision).  You may not
	specify any type other than smallint; integer, decimal, and float
	literals are illegal. For example, decimal(123, 10, 2) is legal,
	but decimal(123, 10, 2.0) is illegal.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Change the usage of the decimal() conversion function to conform to
	the rules stated above.


E_PS0C84_TERNARY_FUNC:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR

	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Assure that a NEXT VALUE operator is requested in the same statement
	or in a previously executed statement in the transaction.


E_QE00A5_END_OF_PARTITION:SS02000_NO_DATA


 Parameters:
	none.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made (typically with a scrollable cursor) to fetch
	a row from a position outside the result set. Can also occur when
	a FETCH is issued after the last row has already been fetched. 
	The result is a "no data" SQLSTATE condition.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Assure that FETCH statements reference rows in the result set.

E_QE0138_CANT_CREATE_UNIQUE_CONSTRAINT:SS23501_UNIQUE_CONS_VIOLATION


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to add a unique constraint to a pre-existing
	table.  Unfortunately, the table contains duplicate tuples on
	the columns which the user specified in an "ALTER TABLE ADD
	CONSTRAINT" statement.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Delete duplicate tuples, and try again.


E_QE0139_CANT_ADD_REF_CONSTRAINT:SS23000_CONSTR_VIOLATION


 Parameters:
	%0c - referencing table name
	%1c - referenced table name

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to add a referential constraint linking pre-existing
	tables.  Unfortunately, the referring table contains tuples whose keys
	don't match any keys in the referenced table.  That is, the data
	currently in the tables already violates the referential constraint.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The following query will show you which rows in the referencing
	table don't have corresponding keys in the referenced table:

		SELECT * FROM
		( referencingTable leftTable LEFT JOIN
		  referencedTable rightTable
		    ON leftTable.1stKeyColumn = rightTable.1stKeyColumn
			...
		    AND leftTable.LastKeyColumn = rightTable.LastKeyColumn
		)
		WHERE rightTable.1stKeyColumn IS NULL;

	Force the tables to agree by either 1) deleting rows from the
	referencing table, or 2) inserting new rows into the referenced table.


E_QE013A_CANT_CREATE_CONSTRAINT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to add a unique or referential constraint. 
	An attempt by Ingres to create the index needed to support the
	constraint failed. See the error log for the index error. It
	is possible that the index creation failed because of conflicting
	index definition options supplied with the constraint definition.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Confirm the validity of any index options specificed with the
	constraint definition and try again.


E_QE0140_CANT_EXLOCK_REF_TABLE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to add a referential constraint linking pre-existing
	tables.  Unfortunately, either the referring table or the referenced
	table is open in some other user's transaction.  While we build
	support for enforcing the constraint, we must be sure that no one
	can corrupt the data.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Find out who is accessing the table, and get them to commit their work.

 Parameters:
	%0c - group name

 Explanation:
	The qeu_dgroup() function discovered a group member record that did not
	have an associated anchor record.  This should never happen.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure that no user deleted the anchor tuple.  Contact
	Technical Support.


E_QE0163_GRPMEM_PURGE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - group name
	%1c - member name

 Explanation:
	The qeu_dgroup() function detected a request to purge, but the input
	tuple represented a member, not an anchor.  This is inconsistent.

	issued a previous message indicating the exact nature of the failure.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_QE0165_NONEXISTENT_RULE:SS42505_OBJ_NOT_FOUND


E_QE0166_NO_CONSTRAINT_IN_SCHEMA:SS42505_OBJ_NOT_FOUND


 Parameters:
	%0c - constraint name
	%1c - schema name

 Explanation:
	A constraint with a name specified by the user could not be found
	in the schema to which the table named in the "ALTER TABLE" statement
	belongs.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement and reenter.


E_QE0167_DROP_CONS_WRONG_TABLE:SS42505_OBJ_NOT_FOUND


 Parameters:
	%0c - constraint name
	%1c - schema name
	%2c - table name

 Explanation:
	A constraint with a name specified by the user exists, but not on the
	table named in the "ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT" statement.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement and reenter.


E_QE0168_ABANDONED_CONSTRAINT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - constraint name

 Explanation:
	Restricted destruction of a UNIQUE constraint may not proceed because
	it would render some REFERENCES constraint abandoned.  To effect
	destruction of the UNIQUE constraint along with dependent constraints,
	one must specify an "ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT CASCADE" statement.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement and reenter.


E_QE0169_UNKNOWN_OBJTYPE_IN_DROP:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - object type found in iidbdepends.dbv_dtype

 Explanation:
	In the course of processing cascading destruction, QEF has encountered
	an object of a type with which it was not prepared to deal. This could
	be caused by corruption of data in iidbdepends.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your Ingres Corporation Technical Support representative.


E_QE016A_NOT_DROPPABLE_CONS:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - constraint name

 Explanation:
	Normal check constraints are implemented as
	internal rules on a table.  These rules can be easily
	dropped when the constraint is dropped.
	
	In the ANSI/ISO SQL92 standard, "NOT NULL" is considered
	to be another form of a CHECK constraint, equivalent to
	"CHECK (<column> IS NOT NULL)".

	But when the user defines a column as "NOT NULL", this is
	implemented as a non-nullable datatype, instead of as
	a rule (as it would for a normal check constraint).  So,
	since we cannot (in 6.5) alter the datatype of a column,
	this "NOT NULL" "constraint" cannot be dropped.
	
	NOTE: For ANSI compatibility, we create a tuple in the
	constraints catalog to represent this "NOT NULL" "constraint",
	so a user can find the name of this "constraint" and try to
	drop it.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Do not attempt to drop this constraint.  If you need to insert
	nulls into a "NOT NULL" column, you must recreate the table with
	a nullable datatype for that column.


E_QE016B_COLUMN_HAS_OBJECTS:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	None

 Explanation:
	Restricted destruction of a column cannot proceed because it has been
	determined that it has one or more dependent objects which would
	become abandoned. This may be a view, constraint, rule, permission etc.

	To effect destruction of the base table column along with all the
	dependent objects, specify "ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN CASCADE".

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement and reenter.


E_QE0199_CALL_ALLOC:SS50003_EXHAUSTED_RESOURCE


 Parameters:
	%0c - procedure name
	%1c - rule name (if from a rule) or NULL
	%2c - current nesting depth of the procedure query plan

 Explanation:
	A deeply nested or recursive rule (or procedure) has caused the QEF
	server facility to exceed the amount of memory allocated for this
	session.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Request from your system administrator to allocate more memory
	per session by increasing the values of the startup options specified
	in the error message.  If this is not an alternative, then try to
	modify the flow of the procedure (or rule) so that the nesting
	depth is decreased.


E_QE019A_EVENT_MESSAGE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0 - name of dbevent operation

 Explanation:
	An attempt to register a dbevent failed because, when the dbevent is
	later raised, the system will attempt to transmit a new GCA message
	type to your registered application.  This message type, however,
	belongs to a more recent version of GCA and cannot be interpreted by
	your application (losing the functionality of dbevents).

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Relink your application with a more recent set of run-time libraries.


E_QE019B_DMM_CREATE_DB_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	During the initial creation of a new database, the server encountered
	an internal error. Additional details about the precise error should
	already have been logged in the error log file, and these
	additional error messages describe the actual problem encountered.

 System Status:
	The createdb operation is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The error log should contain additional error messages, possibly
	beginning with the prefix "E_DMxxxx", that will describe the actual
	problem that was encountered when creating the database. Using the
	information in these messages, resolve the error condition and reissue
	the createdb command. If you are unable to determine the reason for the
	error, contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_QE019C_SEC_WRITE_ERROR:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error was detected while attempting to write a security audit record.
	Additional details about the precise error should already have been
	logged in the error log file, and these additional error
	messages describe the actual problem encountered.

 System Status:
	The operation is aborted. The DBMS may stop auditing or shut down,
	depending on the action selected by the security audit configuration.

 Recommendation:
	Check the system status and retry.


E_QE019D_INVALID_ROLEGRANT_OP:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The qeu_rolegrant() function encountered an invalid operation code
	in qeu_agid_mask. This is an internal error.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_QE0200_NO_EVENTS:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0 - dbevent operation name

 Explanation:
	An attempt to "REGISTER", "REMOVE" or "RAISE" a dbevent failed,
	because the internal dbevent subsystem has not been initialized.
	This can occur if:
	  - the server DBEVENTS=0 command-line parameter was used
	  - the DBMS server startup phase encountered a memory allocation error
	  - the dbevent subsystem encountered a connect-time error
	  - the DBMS dbevent thread was removed (through iimonitor) or exited
	      due to internal dbevent errors

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	If the server has been installed with DBEVENTS=0, the above
	statements are not allowed.

	All other errors are detailed in the server error log. Determine
	which server the user is currently using, and check that
	server's error log for dbevent-related errors.  The action
	to take will depend on the error discovered.


E_QE0201_BAD_SORT_KEY:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


E_QE0202_RESOURCE_CHCK_INVALID:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error internal to QEF has occurred. QEF has attempted to apply
	resource checking to a node that does not use query resources. Only
	nodes containing QEP's use query resources. Essentially, resource
	checking has been invoked by an action procedure that does not
	implement query processing.

 System Status:
	The current query is aborted with a fatal error status.

 Recommendation:
	Report this internal system error to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_QE0203_DIO_LIMIT_EXCEEDED:SS50003_EXHAUSTED_RESOURCE


 Parameters:
	%0d - estimated number of I/O operations required to execute the query
	%1d - I/O limit established for this session

 Explanation:
	Each user may be constrained by resource limits established by the
	DBA or system administrator. The limits may be individually
	established for each database via the GRANT statement.

	Each query that is executed contains an estimate of the resources
	required to execute the query. If the estimate for a query exceeds
	the resource limit established for the current session, the query
	request is rejected. In this case, the estimate of I/O operations
	exceeded the limit for this session.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted with a fatal error.

 Recommendation:
	1. Attempt to run a variant of the query that will use fewer resources.
	   This may be possible by adding additional qualifications to the
	   query or by further restricting the range of values in current
	   qualifications.
	2. Determine if the database is properly organized for efficient
	   execution of the query under consideration. If this is a common
	   query, it may be advisable to change the storage structures or
	   index structures on the tables involved.
	3. Ask your DBA or system administrator to increase your
	   resource limits.


E_QE0204_ROW_LIMIT_EXCEEDED:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	%0d - estimated number of rows returned by the query
	%1d - row limit established for this session

 Explanation:
	Each user may be constrained by resource limits established by the
	DBA or system administrator. The limits may be individually
	established for each database via the "GRANT" statement.

	Each query that is executed contains an estimate of the resources
	required to execute the query. If the estimate for a query exceeds the
	resource limit established for the current session, the query request
	is rejected. In this case, the estimate of the number of rows to be
	returned to the application exceeded the limit for this session. Note
	that this limit applies only to "SELECT" and "OPEN CURSOR" statements.
	Statements that do not return rows to the application such as "INSERT",
	"UPDATE", "DELETE", and "SELECT AS" ignore this limit.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted with a fatal error.

 Recommendation:
	1. Attempt to run a variant of the query that will return fewer
	   rows. This may be possible by adding additional qualifications
	   to the query or by further restricting the range of values in
	   current qualifications.
	2. Ask your DBA or system administrator to increase your
	   resource limits.


E_QE0205_CPU_LIMIT_EXCEEDED:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	%0d - estimated units of CPU resource required to execute the query
	%1d - CPU resource limit established for this session

 Explanation:
	Each user may be constrained by resource limits established by the
	DBA or system administrator. The limits may be individually
	established for each database via the "GRANT" statement.

	Each query that is executed contains an estimate of the resources
	required to execute the query. If the estimate for a query exceeds
	the resource limit established for the current session, the query
	request is rejected. In this case, the estimate of CPU resources
	exceeded the limit for this session. Note that CPU resources are
	estimated in normalized units and provide only a relative measure
	of the CPU time required to execute a query. The estimates do not
	correspond to the actual CPU time used on a specific processor.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted with a fatal error.

 Recommendation:
	1. Attempt to run a variant of the query that will use fewer resources.
	   This may be possible by adding additional qualifications to the
	   query or by further restricting the range of values in current
	   qualifications.
	2. Determine if the database is properly organized for efficient
	   execution of the query under consideration. If this is a common
	   query, it may be advisable to change the storage structures or
	   index structures on the tables involved.
	3. Ask your DBA or system administrator to increase your
	   resource limits.


E_QE0206_PAGE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	%0d - estimated number of pages referenced to execute the query
	%1d - page reference limit established for this session

 Explanation:
	Each user may be constrained by resource limits established by the
	DBA or system administrator. The limits may be individually
	established for each database via the "GRANT" statement.

	Each query that is executed contains an estimate of the resources
	required to execute the query. If the estimate for a query exceeds
	the resource limit established for the current session, the query
	request is rejected. In this case, the estimate of the number of
	database pages referenced by the query exceeded the limit for this
	session.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted with a fatal error.

 Recommendation:
	1. Attempt to run a variant of the query that will use fewer resources.
	   This may be possible by adding additional qualifications to the
	   query or by further restricting the range of values in current
	   qualifications.
	2. Determine if the database is properly organized for efficient
	   execution of the query under consideration. If this is a common
	   query, it may be advisable to change the storage structures or
	   index structures on the tables involved.
	3. Ask your DBA or system administrator to increase your
	   resource limits.


E_QE0207_COST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	%0d - estimated cost to execute the query
	%1d - cost limit established for this session

 Explanation:
	Each user may be constrained by resource limits established by the
	DBA or System Administrator. The limits may be individually
	established for each database via the "GRANT" statement.

	Each query that is executed contains an estimate of the resources
	required to execute the query. If the estimate for a query exceeds
	the resource limit established for the current session, the query
	request is rejected. In this case, the total estimated cost
	exceeded the limit for this session. The total estimated cost is
	a normalized function of the estimated number of I/O operations and
	estimated CPU cost to execute the query. This number serves only
	as a relative measure and does not represent physical resources
	consumed on a specific processor.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted with a fatal error.

 Recommendation:
	1. Attempt to run a variant of the query that will use fewer resources.
	   This may be possible by adding additional qualifications to the
	   query or by further restricting the range of values in current
	   qualifications.
	2. Determine if the database is properly organized for efficient
	   execution of the query under consideration. If this is a common
	   query, it may be advisable to change the storage structures or
	   index structures on the tables involved.
	3. Ask your DBA or system administrator to increase your
	   resource limits.


E_QE0208_EXCEED_MAX_CALL_DEPTH:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	%0d - maximum nesting level for database procedures

 Explanation:
	This error will occur when executing queries that trigger rule
	processing. The rule processing may be such that a query triggers
	a rule, a query within that rule triggers another rule, and so on.
	Each such nested rule firing causes the execution of the database
	procedure associated with the rule to be stacked and the database
	procedure invoked by the newly triggered rule to begin execution.
	The maximum depth of such nesting is constrained by an internal
	system parameter. The current query has triggered rule execution
	that has cascaded beyond the maximum depth allowed.

 System Status:
	The original query triggering rule execution is aborted with a
	fatal error. All queries run by the database procedures invoked
	by rule processing are rolled back.

 Recommendation:
	The following are possible causes of this error:
	    1. The collection of rules defined in the database establishes
	       dependencies between more tables than are supported by the
	       system. Both the database design and the set of rules defined
	       should be inspected and changed to limit the dependencies
	       between tables.
	    2. Circular dependencies may be defined that will cause rules
	       to cascade indefinitely. Inspect the set of rules defined
	       and modify one or more rules in the offending rule set.


E_QE0209_BAD_RULE_STMT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement name

 Explanation:
	This error will occur when executing queries that trigger rule
	processing.  Various statements cannot be issued while processing a
	rule, as they modify the state of the database in relation to the
	original query that fired the rule.  Currently statements that cannot
	be issued from within rule processing are: "COMMIT" and "ROLLBACK".

 System Status:
	The original query triggering rule execution is aborted with a
	fatal error. All queries run by the database procedures invoked
	by rule processing are rolled back.

 Recommendation:
	If the database procedure invoked by the rule is also used
	independently (via the "EXECUTE PROCEDURE" statement), add another
	parameter to the procedure that enables the conditional issuing of
	the violating statement.

	If the database procedure is always invoked from a rule, remove
	the violating statement, and issue it after control returns to the
	application.


E_QE020A_EVENT_EXISTS:SS42502_DUPL_OBJECT


 Parameters:
	%0c - dbevent name

 Explanation:
	The named dbevent already exists for the current user.  Duplicate
	dbevent names are not allowed.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Choose a unique name for the new dbevent, or delete the existing named
	dbevent.


E_QE020B_EVENT_ABSENT:SS42505_OBJ_NOT_FOUND


 Parameters:
	%0c - dbevent name

 Explanation:
	The named dbevent does not exist for the current user; dbevents owned
	by other users cannot be dropped.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Retype the dbevent name.


E_QE020C_EV_REGISTER_EXISTS:SS42502_DUPL_OBJECT


 Parameters:
	%0c - dbevent owner
	%1c - dbevent name

 Explanation:
	The named dbevent is already registered for the current application.
	Duplicate dbevent registrations are not allowed.

 System Status:
	The current "REGISTER" statement is aborted, but the original
	registration remains in effect.  If this statement was issued from
	within a database procedure, the error causes the default error
	semantics of database procedures.

 Recommendation:
	Control the registration of dbevents to only register them once.
	The "REMOVE DBEVENT" statement may be used to de-register a dbevent.


E_QE020D_EV_REGISTER_ABSENT:SS42505_OBJ_NOT_FOUND


 Parameters:
	%0c - dbevent owner
	%1c - dbevent name

 Explanation:
	The named dbevent is not (yet) registered for the current application.
	Registration removal may only apply to registered dbevents.  Note
	that application (session) termination automatically removes all your
	registrations.

 System Status:
	The current "REMOVE" statement is aborted without modifying the state
	of already registered dbevents.  If this statement was issued from
	within a database procedure, the error causes the default error
	semantics of database procedures.

 Recommendation:
	Control the registration and de-registration of dbevents to only
	register dbevents once, and only remove them after they are registered.


E_QE020E_EV_PERMIT_ABSENT:SS42505_OBJ_NOT_FOUND


 Parameters:
	%0c - dbevent name
	%1c - current user

 Explanation:
	The named dbevent does not exist.  Privileges may only be granted or
	revoked on existing dbevents.  If a dbevent is dropped, all privileges
	associated with that dbevent are also dropped.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Use the "CREATE DBEVENT" statement to recreate the dbevent.


E_QE020F_EVENT_SCF_FAIL:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - current statement name ("REGISTER", "REMOVE", or "RAISE")
	%1c - internal failure status
	%2c - dbevent owner
	%3c - dbevent name

 Explanation:
	The current operation failed due to an internal failure.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Check the DBMS error log file for more information.  This may be
	an internal error, or you may have encountered server initialization
	errors.  Check the error log for earlier dbevent-related errors.


E_QE0210_QEC_ALTER:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The qec_alter() function returned bad status when storing session
	database privileges.  This is an internal error, probably due to
	a bad control block.

 System Status:
	If it occurs during session initialization, the session
	is disconnected.

 Recommendation:
	Contact the system administrator.


E_QE022A_IIUSERGROUP:SS5000J_INCONSISTENT_DBMS_CAT


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued if SCF or QEF have trouble opening,
	reading, or writing this catalog.  It will
	appear if that catalog has been clobbered, or if it doesn't
	exist.

 System Status:

 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued if SCF or QEF have trouble opening,
	reading, or writing this catalog.  It will appear
	if that catalog has been clobbered, or if it doesn't exist.

 System Status:
	If it occurs during session initialization, the session is
	disconnected; superusers are allowed to continue. If it occurs
	while processing GRANT/REVOKE statements for database privileges,
	the statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your system administrator.


E_QE022D_IIDATABASE:SS5000J_INCONSISTENT_DBMS_CAT


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued if QEF has trouble opening, reading, or
	closing this catalog.  It will appear if that catalog
	has been clobbered, or if it doesn't exist.

 System Status:

E_QE022E_IIUSER:SS5000J_INCONSISTENT_DBMS_CAT


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued if QEF has trouble opening, reading, or closing
	this catalog.  It will appear if that catalog has been clobbered,
	or if it doesn't exist.

 System Status:
	If it occurs while processing "GRANT" or "REVOKE" statements for
	database privileges, the statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your system administrator.


E_QE022F_SCU_INFO_ERROR:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued if QEF gets a bad return code from
	scu_information().

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your system administrator.


E_QE0239_SEQ_PERMIT_ABSENT:SS42505_OBJ_NOT_FOUND


 Parameters:
	%0c - sequence name
	%1c - current user

 Explanation:
	The named sequence does not exist.  Privileges may only be granted or
	revoked on existing sequences.  If a sequence is dropped, all privileges
	associated with that sequence are also dropped.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Use the "CREATE SEQUENCE" statement to recreate the sequence.


E_QE0240_BAD_LOC_TYPE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to change the attributes of a WORK location
	but the internal procedure was invoked with invalid
	parameters.  This procedure is used to change a defaultable WORK
	location extension to an auxiliary WORK location extension, or vice
	versa.  Upon decoding the parameters sent to it, we discovered that
	neither of these operations was being attempted.  Anything else is
	invalid, so we issue this error.

	Users should not be invoking this procedure themselves.  The accessdb
	utility should be the only program to call this procedure, and if this
	error is encountered while using accessdb, then this should be
	considered an accessdb bug.

 System Status:
	The procedure invocation is nullified; no net effect.  The accessdb
	utility reports an error, and the operation fails.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your system administrator.


E_QE0241_DB_NOT_EXTENDED:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to change the attributes of a WORK location before
	the database was extended to this location; this is not allowed.  You
	must first extend the database to a location, and then alter the
	extension.

 System Status:
	The accessdb utility fails without making the requested change to
	the location.

 Recommendation:
	Extend the database to this location first.


E_QE0242_BAD_EXT_TYPE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to invoke the iiQEF_alter_extension internal
	procedure to change a location extension; however, the type of this
	extension was either not a WORK location (which is illegal) or it
	was not the specified type of WORK location.

	For example, if you attempt to change a defaultable WORK location
	extension to an auxiliary WORK location extension, but this extension
	is already an auxiliary WORK location extension, you will get this
	error.

 System Status:
	The accessdb utility fails without making the requested change to the
	location.

 Recommendation:
	Correct your action based on the above information.


E_QE0243_CNF_INCONSIST:SS5000J_INCONSISTENT_DBMS_CAT


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Preliminary checks in QEF based on the information in the iiextend
	catalog were satisfied, but DMF found that the information in the
	database's configuration file was inconsistent with this information.

	This is an internal error and should be reported as a bug.

 System Status:
	The procedure invocation is nullified; no net effect.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your system administrator.


E_QE0244_TOO_FEW_LOCS:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The user attempted an operation which required a minimum of one
	WORK location; but no WORK location was found.  WORK locations are
	required for operations such as sorting.  See the documentation set
	for more information.  In particular, see the sections on WORK
	locations and the SET WORK LOCATIONS command.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	If you want to successfully complete this operation, you must have at
	least one WORK location.  If you or the application you are running has
	issued a SET WORK LOCATIONS command to reduce the number of WORK
	locations, you may add some of these back using this command.  If
	you have no WORK locations because of a GRANT NOALLOCATE, you must
	consult the DBA of the database to obtain a GRANT ALLOCATE on at least
	one WORK location.


E_QE0245_TOO_MANY_LOCS:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The caller attempted an operation which can make use of a maximum of
	256 WORK locations, but the operation would require more.  WORK
	locations are required for operations such as sorting.  See the
	documentation set for more information.  In particular, see the
	sections on WORK locations and the "SET WORK LOCATIONS" statement.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	If you want to successfully complete this operation, you must decrease
	the number of WORK locations your session is using.  You can accomplish
	this either with a "SET WORK LOCATIONS" statement, or by having the DBA
	of the database issue a "GRANT NOALLOCATE" statement. See the 
	documentation set for more details.


E_QE0250_ABANDONED_PERMIT:SS2B000_DEP_PRIV_EXISTS


 Parameters:
	%0d - permit number
	%1c - object type
	%2c - object name
	%3c - object owner

 Explanation:
	The "DROP PERMIT" or "REVOKE ... RESTRICT" issued by the user will not
	be allowed to complete, because it would render some permit abandoned.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Use "REVOKE ... CASCADE" to revoke a privilege and destroy all
	objects/permits dependent on it.


E_QE0251_ABANDONED_VIEW:SS2B000_DEP_PRIV_EXISTS


 Parameters:
	%0c - view name
	%1c - view owner

 Explanation:
	The "DROP PERMIT" or "REVOKE ... RESTRICT" issued by the user will not
	be allowed to complete, because it would render some view abandoned.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Use "REVOKE ... CASCADE" to revoke a privilege and destroy all
	objects/permits dependent on it.


E_QE0252_ABANDONED_DBPROC:SS2B000_DEP_PRIV_EXISTS


 Parameters:
	%0c - database procedure name
	%1c - database procedure owner

 Explanation:
	The "DROP PERMIT" or "REVOKE ... RESTRICT" issued by the user will not
	be allowed to complete, because it would render some database procedure
	abandoned.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Use "REVOKE ... CASCADE" to revoke a privilege and destroy all
	objects/permits dependent on it.


E_QE0253_ALL_PRIV_NONE_REVOKED:SS01006_PRIV_NOT_REVOKED


 Parameters:
	%0c - grantee type
	%1c - grantee name
	%2c - object name
	%3c - grantor name

 Explanation:
	A "REVOKE ALL [PRIVILEGES]" was specified, but for this combination of
	grantor, object, and grantee, no privileges could be revoked because
	none existed.

 System Status:
	Processing continues for the remaining grantees and/or objects.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_QE0254_SOME_PRIV_NOT_REVOKED:SS01006_PRIV_NOT_REVOKED


 Parameters:
	%0c - object name
	%1c - grantee type
	%2c - grantee name
	%3c - grantor name

 Explanation:
	A "REVOKE <privilege list>" was specified, but for this combination of
	grantor, object, and grantee some of the specified privileges could not
	be revoked, because they did not exist.

 System Status:
	Those of the specified privileges that were found will be revoked;
	processing will continue for the remaining combinations of objects
	and/or grantees.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_QE0255_NO_SCHEMA_TO_DROP:SS42505_OBJ_NOT_FOUND


 Parameters:
	%0c - schema name
	%1c - schema owner

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to drop a nonexistent schema.  

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	If the specified name was incorrect, correct the query and reenter.


E_QE0256_NONEMPTY_SCHEMA:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - schema name
	%1c - schema owner
	%2c - object type (one of: table, view, synonym, database procedure,
	        or dbevent)
	%3c - object name

 Explanation:
	The user attempted restricted destruction of a schema that contains
	at least one table, view, synonym, dbevent or database procedure.
	Restricted destruction of a schema may proceed only if it does not
	contain any tables, views, synonyms, database procedures, or dbevents.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	If the user wants to destroy the schema along with any objects
	contained therein, a "DROP SCHEMA <schema name> CASCADE" must be
	used.


E_QE0257_ABANDONED_CONSTRAINT:SS2B000_DEP_PRIV_EXISTS


 Parameters:
	%0c - constraint name
	%1c - schema name
	%2c - table name

 Explanation:
	A "DROP PERMITA " or "REVOKE ... RESTRICT" issued by the user will
	not be allowed to complete because it would render some constraint
	abandoned.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Use "REVOKE ... CASCADE" to revoke a privilege and destroy all
	objects/permits dependent on it.


E_QE0258_ILLEGAL_XACT_STMT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 System Status:
	The commit/abort/rollback transaction will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the transaction modifying statement (COMMIT/ABORT/ROLLBACK)
	from the database procedure or direct execute immediate.


E_QE0259_INTERNAL_DEADLOCK:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:

	QEF tried to get the default label, but failed unexpectedly.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for more information about why this error
	occurred, then correct the problem.


E_QE0282_IIPROFILE:SS5000J_INCONSISTENT_DBMS_CAT


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This message is issued if QEF has trouble opening, reading, or
	closing this catalog.  Check the error log for
	more information about why this condition occurred.

 System Status:
	If it occurs while processing CREATE/ALTER USER/PROFILE statements
	for subject privileges, the statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your system administrator.


E_QE0285_PROFILE_USER_MRG_ERR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error occurred while attempting to propagate changed profile
	information to user tuples. 

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for more information about why this
	error occurred.


E_QE0286_PROFILE_ABSENT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - profile name

 Explanation:
	A profile tuple was not found in this catalog when it
	was expected to be.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for more information about why this
	error occurred.


E_QE0287_PROFILE_IN_USE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to drop a profile which is in use by users.
	This is only allowed when the "CASCADE" option is specified, when
	those users will have their profile set to the default profile.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for more information about why this
	error occurred.


E_QE0288_DROP_DEFAULT_PROFILE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to drop the default profile. This is not
	allowed. The only operation allowed on the default profile is
	ALTER.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Try to ALTER the profile.


E_QE0289_EXTEND_DB_LOC_LABEL:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to extend a database to a location with
	a security label which it does not dominate. Locations are 
	container objects whose label define the lowest label of objects
	at that location. Because of this, databases extended to a new location
	must dominate the location label.

 System Status:
	The operation is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the database label dominates the location label.

	Technical Support representative.


E_QE028E_DB_NOT_UNEXTENDED:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An attempt was made to unextend a database that has not been extended
	before; this is not allowed.  You must first extend the database to a
	location, and then unextend it.

 System Status:
	The unextenddb utility shows the error without making the requested change to
	the location.

 Recommendation:
	Extend the database to this location first.


E_QE0300_USER_MSG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR 


 Parameters:
	%0c - "MESSAGE" if MESSAGE statement; "ERROR" if RAISE ERROR statement
	%1d - message/error number, or 0 if not specified
	%2c - effective user identifier
	%3c - message/error text, if specified

 Explanation:
	The "DESTINATION" clause of the "MESSAGE" or "RAISE ERROR" statement
	specified the ERROR_LOG option.

 System Status:
	The message is written to the error log.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_QE0301_TBL_SIZE_CHANGE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The database procedure references a table whose size has significantly
	changed since the procedure was compiled.  The procedure will be re-
	compiled.

 System Status:
	The query is recompiled.  This is not an error and will not be
	reported.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_QE0302_SCHEMA_EXISTS:SS42502_DUPL_OBJECT


 Parameters:
	%0c -schema name

 Explanation:
	A "CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION" was issued a second time by the
	same user (having the same autorization identifier).  The schema
	already exists.

 System Status:
	QEF will reject the query.

 Recommendation:
	Issue the DDL statements within the "CREATE SCHEMA" statement without
	the "CREATE SCHEMA" wrapper.


E_QE0303_PARSE_EXECIMM_QTEXT:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	To resolve backward/forward references in a "CREATE SCHEMA" statement,
	the query text for "CREATE VIEW/GRANT" statement(s) is parsed after the
	objects on which the definition of the view/privilege depends is 
	created in QEF.

 System Status:
	The query text will be parsed. This is not an error and will not be
	reported.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_QE0304_SCHEMA_DOES_NOT_EXIST:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - schema name

 Explanation:
	An unknown schema name was encountered.  This may happen during
	DDL if an attempt is made to create an object in a schema which
	has not yet been defined.

 System Status:
	QEF will reject the query.

 Recommendation:
	Try creating the schema.  However, this may also indicate an internal
	server error:  the server is trying to reference a schema which
	it, itself, should have already created.  If that appears to be the
	case, contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_QE0305_UDT_DEFAULT_TOO_BIG:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - UDT attribute
	%1d - maximum size for a UDT default

 Explanation:
	During the conversion of a pre-65 database to release level 65,
	upgradedb fills in iidefault tuples for any pre-existing UDT attributes
	which take defaults.  The iidefault tuple itself has a limited
	length.  If a UDT takes a default that is longer, this error will
	be emitted, and a default will not be filled in for this UDT.

 System Status:
	The upgradedb utility will continue; however, this UDT will not have
	a valid default.

 Recommendation:
	Try recreating the UDT with a smaller default value.


E_QE0306_ALLOCATE_BYREF_TUPLE:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Because SCF does not know the size of the byref parameters before
	a procedure is called, SCF calls QEF, which then returns this
	error to SCF, which can then allocate the tuple and call back QEF.

 System Status:
	SCF will allocate the tuple and call qeq_query() again.

 Recommendation:
	The user should never see this error.


E_QE0307_INIT_MO_ERROR:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	During server startup, the QEF management objects couldn't be
	registered with the IMA internal gateway.


 System Status:
	QEF startup (and therefore server startup) will fail.

 Recommendation:
	The user should never see this error.


E_QE0308_COL_SIZE_MISCOMPILED:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The code generator turned out bad datatype manipulation code.
	More specifically, a column's size was incorrectly compiled.


 System Status:
	The query will fail.

 Recommendation:
	This indicates a bug in OPC (the code generator).  As a workaround,
	try re-writing the query.



E_QE0309_NO_BMCACHE_BUFFERS:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
      The DBMS cache is not configured for the page size specified.

 System Status:
	The query will fail.

 Recommendation:
      Specify a different page size, or reconfigure the DBMS cache
      and restart the server.



E_QE030A_TTAB_PARM_ERROR:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - global temporary table parameter.
	%1c - database procedure. 

 Explanation:
	A global temporary table parameter was passed to a procedure. 
	Its definition did not exactly match the "set of" formal parameter
	in the database procedure. 

 System Status:
	QEF will reject the query.

 Recommendation:
	The table's column definitions must exactly match the "set of"
	parameter definition (column names, data types and nullability).
	Assure that this is the case, and retry the "execute procedure"
	statement.


E_QE030B_RULE_PROC_MISMATCH:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - rule name.
	%1c - procedure name.

 Explanation:
	A row level rule triggers the invocation of a procedure with a 
	SET OF parameter. Only statement level rules may invoke SET OF 
	procedures. 

 System Status:
	QEF will reject the query.

 Recommendation:
	Either the rule must be changed to be statement level, or the 
	procedure must be recoded to use a simple (non-SET OF) parameter
	list.


E_QE030C_BYREF_IN_ROWPROC:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - procedure name.

 Explanation:
	A row producing procedure (one containing "return row" statements)
	cannot be invoked with a "byref" parameter (the execute procedure 
	statement included a parameter with the "byref" notation).

 System Status:
	QEF will reject the query.

 Recommendation:
	The "byref" notation must be removed from all parameters in the
	execute procedure statement.


E_QE030D_NESTED_ROWPROCS:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - procedure name.

 Explanation:
	A row producing procedure (one containing "return row" statements)
	cannot be invoked from within another procedure.

 System Status:
	QEF will reject the query.

 Recommendation:
	Row producing procedures may not be the target of nested calls. 


E_QE030E_RULE_ROWPROCS:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - procedure name.

 Explanation:
	A row producing procedure (one containing "return row" statements)
	cannot be the target of a rule invocation.

 System Status:
	QEF will reject the query.

 Recommendation:
	Do not define rules which execute row producing procedures.


E_QE0400_GATEWAY_ERROR:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An error status was returned by an gateway. Check the
	error log for more specific information on the problem.

 System Status:
	The query/statement will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the problem and rerun the query.


E_QE0401_GATEWAY_ACCESS_ERROR:SS50005_GW_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The user attempted to perform an illegal operation on a gateway table.

 System Status:
	The query/statement will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the problem and rerun the query.

 Explanation:
	Two threads tried to build the same cache object at the same time. The
	other thread ran into a resource problem or was unable to read the
	default from the defaults system catalog for a variety of reasons.  This
	thread was counting on using the cache object the other thread was
	unable to build.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log to see why the other thread failed to build
	the default cache object, and take any appropriate corrective action.


E_RD001D_NO_SUCH_DEFAULT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	RDF was asked to retrieve an attribute default for a default ID that
	is not in the system catalog.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure that the default is created before referencing it.

	not all blanks), and the shistlength field contains a length <= 0.

 System Status:
	The default histogram is used for this column in the optimizer.

 Recommendation:
	Run optimizedb on the column.


E_RD010D_BAD_CKSUM:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
      None.

 Explanation:
 	RDF found a checksum error on one of its cache objects.  This usually
	indicates memory corruption.  Checksum checking can be turned off by
	setting trace point rd22.

 System Status:

E_RD013C_BAD_QRYTRE_RNGSIZ:SS5000J_INCONSISTENT_DBMS_CAT


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Version 3 query trees should never have more than PST_3NUMVARS [30]
	range table entries.  However, this version 3 query tree has more than
	30 range entries.  This indicates that the DBMS catalogs are damaged
	or inconsistent.  Either the tree version is incorrect or the data
	contained in the tree is corrupted.  RDF cannot guess what is wrong and
	attempt a recovery.  There is no way to determine what the correct
	number of range entries is, and reading the rest of the tree depends on
	knowning this.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted, and RDF cannot read the query tree.

 Recommendation:
	The DBMS system catalogs are corrupted.  It may not be possible to
	fix the query tree.  However, the user should be able to find the
	corresponding query text and recreate the query using tm.


E_RD013D_CREATE_COMMENT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	QEF does most of the work of adding the comment to the DBMS catalogs.
	QEF returned an error, indicating that it did not successfully add the
	comment to the DBMS catalog.

 System Status:
	The "CREATE COMMENT" statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the QEF error message in the error log
	and take any corrective action based on that message. The user may also
	run verifydb to see if the DBMS catalogs are corrupted.


E_RD013E_DROP_COMMENT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	QEF does most of the work of dropping the comment from the DBMS
	catalogs.  QEF returned an error, indicating that it did not
	successfully drop the comment from the DBMS catalog.

	NOTE: Currently, the "DROP COMMENT" statement is implemented by
	creating a comment with null short and long text.  However, this
	message is included for future growth.

 System Status:
	The "DROP COMMENT" statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the QEF error message in the error log
	and take any corrective action based on that message. The user may also
	run verifydb to see if the DBMS catalogs are corrupted.


E_RD013F_MISSING_RELINFO:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Either PSF or OPF has called rdu_gdesc() and asked for attribute,
	index, key, or attribute name information without first obtaining
	relation information.

	NOTE: This is not an RDF error, but a severe logic error of
	the calling routine.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	This is an internal error; contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_RD0140_BAD_RELKEY_REQ:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Either PSF or OPF has called rdu_gdesc() and asked for key information
	without first obtaining attribute information.

	NOTE: This is not an RDF error, but a severe logic error of the
	calling routine.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	This is an internal error; contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_RD0141_BAD_ATTHASH_REQ:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	PSF has called rdu_gdesc() and asked for an attribute name hash table
	without first obtaining attribute information.

	NOTE: This is not an RDF error, but a severe logic error of the
	calling routine.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	This is an internal error; contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_RD0142_ULH_ACCESS:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	RDF has found a synonym and determined what the table ID is for the
	table that the synonym resolves to.  It is calling ulh_access() to see
	if the underlying table is already on the cache.  The "not found"
	error, E_UL0109_NFND, is the only error that is expected here, and that
	does not cause this error message.  This is an unexpected error.

 System Status:
	The program continues, but the current "CREATE" statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Try stopping the server and restarting it.  There is some sort of
	cache problem, and restarting the server should clear it.


E_RD0143_CREATE_SYNONYM:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	QEF does most of the work of adding the synonym to the DBMS catalogs.
	QEF returned an error, indicating that it did not successfully add the
	synonym to the DBMS catalog.

 System Status:
	The "CREATE SYNONYM" statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the QEF error message in the error log
	and take any corrective action based on that message. The user may also
	run verifydb to see if the DBMS catalogs are corrupted.


E_RD0144_DROP_SYNONYM:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	QEF does most of the work of deleting a synonym from the DBMS catalogs.
	QEF returned an error, indicating that it did not successfully drop the
	synonym from the DBMS catalog.

 System Status:
	The "DROP SYNONYM" statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user should examine the QEF error message in the error log
	and take any corrective action based on that message. The user may also
	run verifydb to see if the DBMS catalogs are corrupted.


E_RD0145_ALIAS_MEM:SS50003_EXHAUSTED_RESOURCE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	RDF did a ulh_define_alias() call, and ULH returned error
	E_UL0119_ALIAS_MEM.  This is viewed as an error if RDF is attempting
	to create an alias for a table name.  However, if RDF is attempting to
	create an alias for a synonym, then this is just a warning.

	In this case, RDF was attempting to create an alias to a table name,
	so this is an error.  It is probably due to the system not being
	configured with enough synonym memory space or enough tables in the
	RDF cache.

 System Status:
	The program continues, and the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Use cbf to modify the RDF startup parameters. Specify larger numbers
	(defaults are tbl_synonyms=1 and max_tbls=300), restart the server,
	and try again.


E_RD0146_ILLEGAL_TREEVSN:SS5000J_INCONSISTENT_DBMS_CAT


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The server has encountered a tuple which has a version ID
	not supported in this server.  For example:

	    - attempting to read a 6.5 database tree with a 6.3 DBMS server
	    - attempting to read a non-Star database tree with a
	      Star server

	This will only occur if the installation is set up to illegally
	access a database that is not compatible with the current release of
	the DBMS or Star server.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure that the user is attempting to use the correct server on this
	database.


E_RD0147_BAD_QTREE_CLASS:SS5000J_INCONSISTENT_DBMS_CAT


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	RDF was asked to invalidate a QTREE cache class, but the caller did not
	specify what kind of tree it was.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure that the user is attempting to use the correct server on this
	database.


E_RD0148_BAD_QTREE_ALIAS:SS5000J_INCONSISTENT_DBMS_CAT


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	RDF was asked to invalidate a QTREE cache alias, but the caller did not
	specify what kind of tree it was.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure that the user is attempting to use the correct server on this
	database.


E_RD0149_INVALID_TABLETYPE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	RDF has been requested to open a DBMS catalog and retrieve tuples for
	the calling program (usually PSF in qrymod).  RDF keeps track of which
	catalog to open by using an internal table type code.  This table type
	must be specified for any open catalog.  (See rdfint.h typedef for
	RDF_TABLE for possible valid values.)

 System Status:
	RDF refuses the catalog read request, which should generate an
	internal error to the user and abort the statement.

 Recommendation:
	The user should never see this consistency check.  If they do, they
	should contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_RD014A_NONEXISTENT_SYNONYM:SS42505_OBJ_NOT_FOUND


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The synonym specified in the "DROP SYNONYM" statement does not exist.
	This message will never be returned to the user -- it is used for
	inter-facility communication.

 System Status:
	The DBMS will provide the user with a message describing the synonym
	that could not be dropped and proceed to drop other synonyms (if any)
	named in the statement.

 Recommendation:
 	None.


E_RD014B_BAD_PARTCAT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%2c.%3c - the partitioned table

 Explanation:
	RDF is trying to read the partitioning catalogs for the
	table, and has encountered an inconsistency.
	This indicates incorrect data in the catalogs.  Either
	the catalogs were improperly manually updated by a
	privileged user, or there was an Ingres error when constructing
	the catalog entries.

 System Status:
	The current query will be aborted.  Access to the partitioned
	table will be impossible until the catalogs are fixed.

 Recommendation:
	The inconsistency in the catalogs will have to be manually
	fixed.  Contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_RD014C_PCOPY_ERROR:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None

 Explanation:
	An internal check within the partition definition copy function
	failed.  This indicates an internal coding error.

 System Status:
	The current query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	This message is an internal error;  contact Technical Support.


E_RD0150_CREATE_RULE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Upon return from qeu_crule(), QEF indicated a failure.  If this is
	not a user error (such as a duplicate rule name), this error message
	will be logged.  Parameters to qeu_crule() should be checked for in
	rdf_update(), rdr_append(), and rdr_rule().

E_RD018A_EVENT_FAIL:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	RDF uses the server event system to synchronize the RDF
	caches in multiple servers in the same installation.  If
	event_limit is not set high enough, some of the events will
*	not be delivered, making it possible for the caches in 
	multiple servers to become out of sync.

 System Status:
	The statement continues running.

 Recommendation:
	Increase event_limit using CBF, and restart the servers
	in the installation.


E_RD0200_NO_TUPLES:SS42505_OBJ_NOT_FOUND


E_RD0201_PROC_NOT_FOUND:SS42505_OBJ_NOT_FOUND


E_RD0202_ALIAS_DEGRADED:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	RDF accepts the startup parameters from config.dat configuration file.
	One of those parameters, rdf_max_tbls, indicates the maximum number of
	tables RDF may have on its cache (the default is 300).  Another
	parameter, tbl_synonyms, indicates how many synonyms may be defined
	(the default is 1).

	You may have your system configured reasonably, but a lot of concurrent
	activity is keeping RDF memory usage too high to add another synonym to
	RDF's memory cache.  Or, your system may not be configured correctly
	for RDF.

	In either case, you can improve the situation by increasing the
	number of synonyms permitted, by increasing the values for
	max_tbls and tbl_synonyms.  The tradeoff is that the DBMS server will
	use more memory when you increase these values.

 System Status:
	The statement continues running, but will be a bit slower, because the
	server will have to go to disk next time it needs this information
	instead of getting it from memory.

 Recommendation:
	The user may reconfigure RDF startup parameters and restart the server.


E_RD0210_ABANDONED_OBJECTS:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The user issued a "DROP PERMIT" or "REVOKE ... RESTRICT" statement,
	but destruction of the specified privileges would result in some
	object(s) and/or privilege descriptors becoming abandoned (which is
	illegal when the implicit or explicit <drop behavior> is "RESTRICT").

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for a description of an object or a permit
	that would be rendered abandoned by the operation.


E_RD0211_NONEXISTENT_SCHEMA:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The schema named in the "DROP SCHEMA" statement does not exist.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Verify that the schema was specified correctly; if not, correct the
	query and reenter.


E_RD0212_NONEMPTY_SCHEMA:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The user issued a "DROP SCHEMA ... RESTRICT", but the named schema
	still contains tables, views, synonyms, dbevents, or database
	procedures. For restricted revocation to succeed, the schema must
	not contain any objects.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Check the error log for a description of an object still
	contains in the schema.  To destroy the schema and all the objects
	therein, specify a "DROP SCHEMA ... CASCADE" statement.

	continues with the role in effect.

	For non-superusers, a message is logged and returned,
	and the session is terminated.

 Recommendation:
	Contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_SC0261_XENCODE_BAD_PARM:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:

 Explanation:
	scu_xencode() received an invalid password as input.
	Either the pointer to it was null, it was too short,
	too long, or it contained all blanks.

 System Status:
	This status is returned to either psy_[ca]aplid() or scs_dbdb_info().
	The caller will issue a traceback message and determine disposition.

 Recommendation:
	Contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support; scu_xencode() should 
	never see blank passwords.


E_SC0262_XENCODE_BAD_RESULT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	After encoding a password, scu_encode() detected that the resultant
	string had not been altered.

 System Status:
	This status is returned to either psy_[ca]aplid() or scs_dbdb_info().
	The caller will issue a traceback message and determine disposition.

 Recommendation:
	Contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_SC0263_SCA_RISK_CONSISTENCY:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The datatypes being registered for use by this server may not be known
	throughout the installation.  Normally, this is illegal.  However, the
	user-supplied exit has requested that this check be overridden; this
	means the recovery system may not understand the format of the data
	in use. Consequently, it may not be able to correctly recover any data
	for this installation (in the cases where the data formats disagree
	enough to cause a major failure).

 System Status:
	The server may start up (barring other errors).  However, all databases
	in this installation now risk a lack of proper recovery.

 Recommendation:
	None -- this is an informational message only. This request (for risking
	consistency) is intended for use during the test of datatype code, and
	then only in a test installation.  As soon as the system moves to
	production status, this request should be changed.


E_SC0264_SCA_ILLEGAL_MAJOR:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0d,x - user-defined datatype ID

 Explanation:
	The system found an illegal value for a major ID. It is displayed as
	both a decimal (followed by a ".") and as a hexadecimal. The only
	correct values are greater than 0.

 System Status:
	The system will start up, ignoring the user-defined datatypes.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the value and retry.


E_SC0265_SCA_STATE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0d,x - user-defined major ID
	%1d,x - user-defined minor ID
	%2c   - user-defined string

 Explanation:
	The system is attempting to add the specified user datatypes.  This
	message is informational -- providing the user-supplied information.

 System Status:
	No change in system status -- this is an informational message only.

 Recommendation:
	None - this is an informational message only.


E_SC0266_USER_SHUTDOWN:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The system has failed to correctly add the user-supplied datatypes (for
	reasons listed previously in the log file).  The user-supplied
	information requests that the server not start up if this occurs.

 System Status:
	The server will shut down (that is, not complete the startup).

 Recommendation:
	Correct the problem and retry.


E_SC0267_SCA_ID_UNKNOWN:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The system cannot determine the user-defined datatype level.

 System Status:
	The system will assume that no user-defined datatypes have been added.
	Further action will be based upon that assumption.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the problem.  This is probably some sort of installation
	problem; perhaps a portion of the recovery system has been killed.


E_SC0268_SCA_RISK_INVOKED:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The system is approving the use of datatypes based upon the request to
	override the major and minor IDs in use by the installation.  See
	message E_SC0263_RISK_CONSISTENCY for more details on the risk.

 System Status:
	Data in this installation may be lost and/or databases may be marked
	inconsistent.

 Recommendation:
	This is an informational message only; no action is required.  However,
	it is advisable to remedy this situation as soon as possible, making the
	installation aware of the datatypes in use and consistent.


E_SC0269_SCA_INCOMPATIBLE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0d,x - major ID of datatypes in use in the installation
	%1d,x - minor ID of datatypes in use in the installation

	NOTE: <0x80000000,0> is the default.

 Explanation:
	The system cannot use the datatypes being proposed, as they are
	incompatible with the installation level.

 System Status:
	The server will shut down.

 Recommendation:
	Correct and restart the installation.

	Alternatively, the add_risk_consistency flag can be set, but only if
	this is a test installation.  SETTING THIS FLAG RISKS THE CONSISTENCY OF
	DATA THROUGHOUT THE INSTALLATION.


E_SC026A_SCA_REGISTER_ERROR:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The system is attempting to define user datatypes.  In doing so, it
	calls the iiudadt_register() routine to obtain the definitions.  This
	routine has returned a non-zero status, which is viewed as an error.

 System Status:
	New datatypes will not be defined.  The system will come up with the
	vendor-supplied defaults.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error in the iiudadt_register() routine.


E_SC026B_INVALID_CURSOR_MODE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c	Invalid mode that was specified.

 Explanation:
	When the server is reading in values from the CONFIG.DAT file,
	it validates the settings.  CURSOR_UPDATE_MODE has only 2 possible
	settings:  DEFERRED and DIRECT.
	The user specified a value different than either of these.

 System Status:
	The server will not start up.  

 Recommendation:
	Either replace the value with a valid one, or remove the line from the
	config.dat file (and then will default to DEFERRED).
	Note that ANSI compatibility requires a value of DIRECT (so you can
	have 2 or more FOR UPDATE cursors opened at the same time using 
	the default cursor mode).


E_SC0270_NO_EVENT_MESSAGE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


E_SC0271_EVENT_THREAD:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0 - operation code corresponding to action

 System Status:
	A system command has been given to alter the state of the event
	thread.  This message is not an error, but may be used to resolve
	dbevent-related errors that are encountered later on.

 Recommendation:
	This is not an error.


E_SC0272_EVENT_THREAD_ADD:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 System Status:
	SCF could not initialize the event thread.

 Recommendation:
	If your application does not require dbevent processing you may ignore
	this error message.


E_SC0273_EVENT_RETRY:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0d - number of connect attempts

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV), when connected to, must allow multiple
	servers to "attach" themselves to the shared memory segment
	associated with the EV.  The current server was not able to attach
	to the segment because the EV has locked out any other servers.
	This may be because the shared EV segment is currently being taken
	down or initialized.

 Recommendation:
	If there are many running servers on your machine, find out if any
	of them are currently just starting or going down.  A server that
	could not attach to the EV will not allow dbevent processing.


E_SC0274_NOTIFY_EVENT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The alert system attempted to notify the client that a dbevent for
	which the client is registered was raised.  This failure was due to
	some form of internal flow failure, where an alert resource was
	lost when the client was about to receive it.

 Recommendation:
	Apply normal error-handling procedures, as the dbevent notification has
	been discarded.


E_SC0275_IGNORE_ASTATE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	When SCF was about to read more data from the client, it noticed that
	the alert state was set to SCS_ASIGNORE.  This state means that when
	the read operation would complete it would not have resumed the
	current session.  Consequently, the current session is terminated.

 System Status:
	The current session is terminated.

 Recommendation:
	Report this problem to the system administrator.  If the DBMS
	event subsystem was taken down while your application was running,
	then ignore this error.  Otherwise, report this error to
	Technical Support.


E_SC0276_CX_RAISE_FAIL:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	none.

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV) was using the CX facility to broadcast
	an event across the cluster, but the CX facility returned an
	error code.

 System Status:
	The event raised is not set to either local or remote servers.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure CX facility was properly configured/initialized.

	Make sure events are being efficently processed, so that the number
	of unprocessed events does not exceed to capacity of the CX
	sub-system.


E_SC0280_NO_ALERT_INIT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	SCF is attempting to register, remove, or raise an alert (dbevent),
	but the SCF event subsystem has not been initialized. This can only
	occur if SCF initialization encountered a memory allocation error
	or an EV connect error.

 Recommendation:
	All initialization errors are detailed in the server error log.
	Determine which server the user is currently using and check that
	server's error log for initialization errors. Any action to take
	will depend on the error discovered.


E_SC0281_ALERT_ALLOCATE_FAIL:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	SCF could not allocate an SCE_ALERT block to contain the dbevent
	registration requested by the user. This will occur if the users
	have allocated too many dbevent registrations or have raised a
	sufficiently large number of dbevents that have not been
	transmitted to the target clients. Both types of operations require
	SCF memory. It is also possible that other SCF memory allocations
	have reduced the amount of SCF memory available.

 Recommendation:
	Check your application programs to be sure they are not registering
	an inordinate number of dbevents or raising a large number of dbevents
	that are not being sent to the client applications. Either correct
	these applications or allocate more SCF memory.


E_SC0282_RSES_ALLOCATE_FAIL:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	SCF could not allocate an SCE_RSESSION block to contain the dbevent
	registration requested by the user. This will occur if the users
	have allocated too many dbevent registrations or have raised a
	sufficiently large number of dbevents that have not been
	transmitted to the target clients. Both types of operations require
	SCF memory. It is also possible that other SCF memory allocations
	have reduced the amount of SCF memory available.

 Recommendation:
	Check your application programs to be sure they are not registering
	an inordinate number of dbevents or raising a large number of dbevents
	that are not being sent to the client applications. Either correct
	these applications or allocate more SCF memory.


E_SC0283_AINST_ALLOCATE_FAIL:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0x - session ID
	%1c - dbevent name

 Explanation:
	SCF could not allocate an SCE_AINST block to contain the dbevent
	notification requested by the user. This will occur if the users
	have allocated too many dbevent registrations or have raised a
	sufficiently large number of dbevents that have not been
	transmitted to the target clients. Both types of operations require
	SCF memory. It is also possible that other SCF memory allocations
	have reduced the amount of SCF memory available.

 Recommendation:
	Check your application programs to be sure they are not registering
	an inordinate number of dbevents or raising a large number of dbevents
	that are not being sent to the client applications. Either correct
	these applications or allocate more SCF memory.


E_SC0284_BUCKET_INIT_ERROR:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0d - number of buckets requested by the user

 Explanation:
	The server event thread would not start, because the specified parameter
	for the number of event buckets is out of bounds. This value must be
	larger than zero and less than some large but environment-specific
	value. This parameter only affects the number of hash buckets into
	which dbevent registrations are placed, so reducing this value should
	have little effect on the operation of the system.

 Recommendation:
	Either remove this option from the server initialization command,
	make the value positive (if < 0), or make the value smaller
	(if very large). NOTE: Values larger than 10,000 for this
	parameter are thought to make little sense.


E_SC0285_EVENT_MEMORY_ALLOC:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0d - total memory (in bytes) required for alert structures
	%1d - number of buckets requested for server (or number of users)

 Explanation:
	The server event thread would not start, because the SCF alert data
	structures could not be allocated.

 Recommendation:
	Check what other threads are running and that they are not (already)
	consuming a lot of SCF memory.  Try to reconfigure your server with
	more SCF memory.


E_SC0286_EVENT_SEM_INIT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - internal name of semaphore for SCF alert structures

 Explanation:
	The server event thread would not start, because the SCF alert
	semaphore could not be initialized.

 Recommendation:
	Check what other threads are running and that they are not (already)
	consuming a lot of system locks. If dbevent processing is not required,
	then this error can be ignored.  Otherwise, try to restart the server.


E_SC0287_AINST_SESSION_ID:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0x - session ID

 Explanation:
	SCF is attempting to notify a client of the occurrence of a dbevent.
	The client's session ID, however, indicates that the client is no
	longer active.  This could occur if a user thread was removed through
	unusual methods and consequently did not remove all of its
	registrations.

 System Status:
	The system continues processing the dbevent for other registered
	sessions.

 Recommendation:
	This error is entered into the log file and does not affect user
	processing.


E_SC0288_XSEV_SM_DESTROY:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - internal name of shared event segment

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV) may attempt to destroy the EV shared segment
	if an EV initialization failed or when the last server disconnects
	from the EV. If the segment cannot be destroyed other servers will not
	be able to connect to a refreshed EV.

 Recommendation:
	Check if other servers are starting up or shutting down at the exact
	same moment.  If so, try to start a new server (to refresh the EV).
	This error may be ignored if your server will not be processing
	dbevents on behalf of applications.  Otherwise, report this problem to
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_SC0289_XSEV_ALLOC:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0d - number of pages

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV), when initialized, attempts to allocate
	a number of shared memory pages.  The number of pages is a function
	of the number of users and event buckets of the first server that
	connects to the EV.

 Recommendation:
	If the number of pages is too high, try to reduce the event-related
	parameters to the "starting server".  This error may be ignored if
	your server will not be processing dbevents on behalf of applications.
	Otherwise, report this problem to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_SC028A_XSEV_CRLOCKLIST:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV), when initialized and when connected to,
	creates a "lock list" on behalf of the connecting server.  This
	list allows multiple servers to be notified (through locks) of dbevents
	that they should process from other servers (through the EV). If the
	lock list could not be created, then the server cannot be notified.
	The system, therefore, does not allow any interaction between this
	server and dbevents.

 Recommendation:
	This error may be ignored if your server will not be processing
	dbevents on behalf of applications.  Otherwise, report this problem to
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_SC028B_XSEV_ATTACH:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - internal name of shared event subsystem segment

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV), when connected to, must allow multiple
	servers to "attach" themselves to the shared memory segment
	associated with the EV.  The current server was not able to attach
	to the segment.  The system, therefore, does not allow any interaction
	between this server and dbevents.

 Recommendation:
	If there are many running servers on your machine, find out if they
	are all using dbevents.  Maybe some of them can be initialized without
	dbevents (see the "events" startup qualifier).  This error may be
	ignored if your server will not be processing dbevents on behalf of
	applications.  Otherwise, report this problem to Ingres Corporation 
	Technical Support.


E_SC028C_XSEV_EALLOCATE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - internal name of data structures being allocated
	%1d - data structure size
	%2d - available space (in bytes) of shared memory pool

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV) could not execute an operation, because
	all the shared EV space was exhausted. If there are many applications
	running with many dbevents, then the EV subsystem may have been
	initialized with too small an amount (determined as a function of
	the number of users and event buckets of the first server that
	connected to the EV). Depending on when this error was encountered,
	it may affect one application or the whole server.

 Recommendation:
	If there are many running servers on your machine, find out if they
	are all using dbevents.  Maybe some of them can be initialized without
	dbevents (see the "events" startup qualifier).  This error may be
	ignored if your server will not be (or is not already) processing
	dbevents on behalf of applications.  Otherwise, report this problem to
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_SC028D_XSEV_REGISTERED:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - full internal name of dbevent (with blanks)

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV) was asked to register a server for a dbevent
	for which the server is already registered.  It is an error to register
	twice. If the server has registered for all dbevents, then it may not
	register for a specific dbevent.

 Recommendation:
	If the request to register the dbevent within the server works (i.e.,
	an application will be notified of the dbevent), then you can ignore
	this error.  Otherwise, this will impact the behavior of the application
	and should be reported to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_SC028E_XSEV_NOT_REGISTERED:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - full internal name of dbevent (with blanks)

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV) was asked to de-register a server for a dbevent
	for which the server is not (yet) registered.  It is an error to
	de-register a nonexisting dbevent.

 Recommendation:
	If the request to remove the dbevent within the server works (i.e.,
	an application will not be notified of the dbevent), then you can ignore
	this error.  Otherwise, this will impact the behavior of the application
	and should be reported to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_SC0290_XSEV_SIGNAL:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0x - process ID of server registered for the dbevent
	%1c - full internal name of dbevent (includes blanks)

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV) attempted to raise a dbevent to all servers
	registered to receive it.  When signaling a specific registered
	server, the EV encountered an LKevent() error. This is usually an error
	on the sender's side and not the recipient's side.  This dbevent will
	not be added to the registered server's event instance queue, with
	the consequence that registered applications will not receive this
	dbevent.

 Recommendation:
	This error may be ignored if your server will not be processing
	dbevents on behalf of applications.  Otherwise, report this problem to
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_SC0291_XSEV_NOT_CONNECT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0x - process ID of server executing the operation
	%1c - internal name of requested operation

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV) may only interact with servers that have
	formally connected to the EV.  A server that did not formally (or
	successfully) connect may not execute any operations against the EV
	(even disconnecting -- though the disconnect error may be ignored).

 Recommendation:
	If this same server had event-related initialization errors (earlier
	in the error log file), then ignore this subsequent error.  Otherwise,
	report this problem to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_SC0292_XSEV_SEM_INIT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - internal name of semaphore

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV) could not be initialized, because an attempt
	to allocate/clear cross-process semaphores (that control shared memory
	data structures) failed.

 Recommendation:
	This error may be ignored if your server will not be processing
	dbevents on behalf of applications.  Otherwise, report this problem to
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_SC0293_XSEV_VERSION:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - internal name of shared event subsystem segment
	%1d - version of already-established event subsystem
	%2d - event-connection version of server attempting to connect

 Explanation:
	The current server could not connect to the event subsystem (EV),
	because the server's EV version did not match the already-established
	version.  Version numbers are modified when internal changes are
	made to the EV data structures (all allocated out of memory shared
	among multiple servers).  Normally, all servers in an installation are
	of the same level.  Internal developers and VARS may have installations
	constructed with multiple servers of different levels.

 Recommendation:
	This error may be ignored if your server will not be processing
	dbevents on behalf of applications.  Otherwise, report this problem to
	Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_SC0294_XSEV_CONFIG_LOC:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0x - CL status returned from NMloc() call

 Explanation:
	The system attempted an NMloc() call to find a pointer to the event
	config file, events.cnf.  This call returned an error status.
	The NMloc() call should succeed even if the file does not exist.
	This error is probably the result of a missing or incorrectly
	defined environment variable.

 System Status:
	The server/system will continue to start up.  Default values will
	be used for event system configuration parameters.

	If this error is actually evidence of more serious environment setup
	problems, then it is likely that other portions of the installation 
	will also encounter problems and the system may not start up.

 Recommendation:
	Check the setting of environment variables.  Check for the existence of 
	the configuration directory and the events.cnf file.  Check for
	file and directory access permissions.


E_SC0295_XSEV_CONFIG_OPEN:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0x - CL status returned from TRset_file() call

 Explanation:
	The server was unable to open the event config file.  This file
	should exist in the configuration directory and is named events.cnf.
	This problem is probably caused by the nonexistence of the event config
	file.  If the file exists, the problem could be caused by file
	access permissions or an incorrect setting of the configuration
	directory.

 System Status:
	The server/system will continue to start up.  Default values will
	be used for event system configuration parameters.

	If this error is actually evidence of more serious environment setup
	problems, then it is likely that other portions of the installation 
	will also encounter problems and the system may not start up.

 Recommendation:
	Check the setting of environment variables.  Check for the existence of 
	the configuration directory and the events.cnf file.  Check for
	file and directory access permissions.


E_SC0296_XSEV_CONFIG_READ:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0x - CL status returned from TRrequest() call

 Explanation:
	The server encountered an error attempting to read a record from
	the event config file.  This may indicate that a record of the
	config file has a bad format.

	A new config file may be created using the Event Utility.

	When this error is encountered, the server will continue starting
	up, but will use default values for any configuration parameters
	it did not find in the config file.  Parameters found before the
	read error will be used.

	The configuration parameters used by the system are written to
	the server trace file if one is defined at startup time. 

 System Status:
	The server/system will continue to start up.  Default values will
	be used for event system configuration parameters.

 Recommendation:
	Use the Event Utility to examine the event config file and create
	a new one if necessary.


E_SC0297_XSEV_CONFIG_VALUE:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0c - parameter name
	%1d - parameter value
	%2d - substituted value

 Explanation:
	The server encountered an error attempting to read a record from
	the event config file.  A value for one of the parameters was out
	of range.  The minimum value for that parameter is substituted
	instead.

 System Status:
	The server/system will continue to start up.

 Recommendation:
	This error message can be avoided by changing the value in the
	event config file.


E_SC0298_EVENT_CONFIG:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	At server startup time, the server connects to the installation's
	Event System.  In order to do this, it must open and read the event
	system's config file.  This action is normally tolerant of errors
	such as a nonexistent config file, read errors, or data format errors.
	The reporting of this error probably means that some error condition
	involving the event config file was overlooked.

 System Status:
	When this error is logged, the server will fail to start up.

 Recommendation:
	The user should look in the installation error log for further
	detail on why the event config file could not be read.  If this
	condition cannot be remedied, the user can create a new event
	config file or start up the server specifying to not use the
	event system.


E_SC0299_EVENTS_DISABLED:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The server startup options specified to use dbevents.  The event
	system config file currently specifies that the event system is
	disabled in this installation.  The server will start up but will
	not connect to the event system.  Applications connected to this
	server will not be able to use alerts or other features which rely
	on the Event System.  To enable the Event System, use the
	Event Utility.  After enabling dbevents, the installation must be
	restarted to bring up the Event System.

 System Status:
	The server will start up, but will not connect to the Event System.
	Applications connected to this sever will not be able to use alerts
	or other features which rely on the Event System.

 Recommendation:
	If the user wants to run without dbevents, no action is necessary.
	Since dbevents were disabled in the event config file, this is probably
	what was desired.  The user can get rid of this error message by
	using the EVENTS=0 server startup option.  If the user wants to
	use dbevents, then the Event System should be enabled using the Event
	Utility.


E_SC029A_EVENT_CLUSTER_INIT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The Event System is initialized by the first process which
	connects to it.  In a cluster installation, this must be the CSP
	process.  If a server on a cluster installation finds that it is
	the first connector to the Event System, then it will fail to
	start up.  This is because it will be unable to properly communicate
	dbevents to other nodes of the installation.

	This error will most likely occur if the system is initialized while
	dbevents are not enabled in the installation, and then later the
	system is modified to specify that dbevents should be used.  Servers
	that start up after dbevents have been enabled will try to connect
	to the Event System, generating this error.

	After enabling dbevents in an installation in which they were previously
	disabled, the entire installation should be brought down and restarted.

 System Status:
	The server will not start up until either dbevents are explicitly
	turned off, or until the installation is restarted so that the CSP
	can be connected to the Event System.

 Recommendation:
	To start a server with dbevent handling, restart the installation to
	connect the CSP to the Event System.

	In order to start a server without restarting the installation, the
	server must be started with options specifying to not do dbevent
	processing.  This is done by using the EVENTS=0 startup option, or
	by turning off dbevents in the installation with the Event Utility.


E_SC029B_XSEV_REQLOCK:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0x - process ID of server registered for the dbevent
	%1c - full internal name of dbevent (includes blanks)

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV) attempted to raise a dbevent to all servers
	registered to receive it.  Prior to broadcasting to a registered
	server, the EV encountered an LKrequest() error.  This usually means
	either the receiving server was abnormally terminated, or the event
	thread in that server abnormally terminated.  This dbevent will
	not be added to the registered server's event instance queue, with
	the consequence that registered applications will not receive this
	dbevent.  No future attempts will be made to deliver events to
	the receiving server.

 Recommendation:
	Check the installation error log to determine why the identified server
	terminated, or why the event thread in that server terminated.  If the
	identified server still exists, use the sceadmin utility to stop and
	restart the event thread for that server.  If the server no longer
	exists, use sceadmin to remove that server's registration from the
	Event Subsystem.


E_SC029C_XSEV_RLSLOCK:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0 - process ID of server affected by the error

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem encountered an error while attempting to
	release (LKrelease()) a server connect lock (LK_EVCONNECT).
	This internal error indicates potential corruption of
	the event (EV) or locking (LK) subsystem.

 Recommendation:
	Report this problem to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_SC029D_XSEV_PREVERR:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0x - process ID of server registered for the dbevent
	%1c - full internal name of dbevent (includes blanks)

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV) encountered previous errors while attempting
	to broadcast events to the indicated server.  As a result, the event
	subsystem has marked the indicated server ineligible to receive further
	events.

 Recommendation:
	Check the installation error log to determine why the identified server
	was disqualified from receiving events. If the identified server still
	exists, use the sceadmin utility to stop and restart the event thread
	for that server.  If the server no longer exists, use sceadmin to
	remove that server's registration from the Event Subsystem.


E_SC029E_XSEV_TSTLOCK:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	%0x - process ID of server registered for the dbevent
	%1c - full internal name of dbevent (includes blanks)

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV) encountered previous errors while attempting
	to determine if the indicated server was still active.  As a result,
	the Event Subsystem has marked the indicated server ineligible to
	receive further events.

 Recommendation:
	If the identified server still exists, use the sceadmin utility
	to stop and restart the event thread for that server.  If the
	server no longer exists, use sceadmin to remove that server's
	registration from the Event Subsystem.


E_SC029F_XSEV_EVCONNECT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The event subsystem (EV), when initialized and when connected to,
	obtains an LK_EVCONNECT lock on behalf of the connecting server.
	This lock allows other servers to detect if this server terminates
	without formally disconnecting from the EV.

 Recommendation:
	This error may be ignored if your server will not be processing
	dbevents on behalf of applications.  If events are required,
	attempt to restart the event thread for this server via the
	sceadmin utility.  If that fails, ensure sufficient locking
	resources are available.


E_SC02C0_CSP_MAIN_ADD:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	An internal error was encountered when the recovery server
	attempted to start the main CSP thread.

 Recommendation:
	This message should only be possible when running in a
	clustered configuration, and startup of the local node 
	should fail if seen.  Contact technical support.


E_SC02C1_CSP_MAIN_EXIT:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:

 Explanation:
	OpenROAD image files are given a version number when created.
	This version number consists of two parts, a major version and
	a minor version.  For an image file to be compatible with
	a OpenROAD executable, the major version number of the image
	file must be the same as the executable's major version number,
	and the minor version number of the image file must be less than
 	or equal to the executable's minor version number.

	In this case, the image's major version number is greater than
	the executable's major version number which means the image was
	created with a newer version of OpenROAD than the executable which
	is being used to run the image file.

 System Status:
	The image will not be run, and the program will exit.

 Recommendation:
	Either run the image on a newer version of the executable
	or create an image with an older version of OpenROAD.

	file must be the same as the executable's major version number,
	and the minor version number of the image file must be less than
 	or equal to the executable's minor version number.

	In this case, the image's major version number is less than
	the executable's major version number which means the image was
	created with an older version of OpenROAD than the executable which

E_UL0118_NUM_ALIASES:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	This is an internal error which may only occur on server startup.
	ulh_init() has been called with a flag indicating that aliases will be
	allowed, but the maximum number of aliases specified by the caller was
	non-positive (<=0).

	This should not occur under normal circumstances.

 System Status:
	The server will not start.

 Recommendation:
	Contact Ingres Corporation Technical Support.


E_UL0119_ALIAS_MEM:SS5000B_INTERNAL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	In order to create a new alias in ULH cache, there should be enough
	memory to accommodate a new alias, and the total number of existing
	aliases should not exceed some number specified at server startup.
	If one of these conditions exists, at least one object must be removed
	from the cache before the new alias can be created.

	This error will occur if no cache entries (with the possible exception
	of the one for which the alias was being created) could be removed from
	the cache.

 System Status:
	The statement will be processed, but performance may be degraded.

 Recommendation:
	The server may have to be shut down and restarted to provide for a
	larger number of synonyms.

E_US07D4_2004:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - attribute qualifier which caused the error

 Explanation:
	NOTE: errors 2003 and 2004 show syntax for 6.4 and before.
	      See new syntax errors 4112 and 4113 for post-6.4 versions.
	
	The accepted syntax diagram for the column qualifier clause is:

	'[[not null [with | not default]] | with null]
		[not | with system_maintained]'

	with one exception. It is not allowed to specify either "not default"
	or "with null" in conjunction with the "with system_maintained" 
	qualifier.

	The order of these qualifiers is significant, and must appear as
	described.  The following is a complete list of accepted attribute
	qualifiers (a few options, although syntactically correct per the 
	above diagrams, are disallowed due to the "with system_maintained"
	restrictions):

		with null
		not null with default
		not null not default
		not null with default with system_maintained
		with null not system_maintained
		not null with default not system_maintained
		not null not default not system_maintained
		with system_maintained
		not system_maintained

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Reissue the "CREATE" statement after correcting the problem with
	the attribute qualifier clause.

E_US07FD_2045:SS50002_LIMIT_EXCEEDED


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A request was made to create a table where the width of the row
	exceeds the maximum allowable row width. The request may be a user
	request to create a user table or an index, or it may be an internal
	request to create a temporary table for use in query execution
	(e.g., temporary tables may be created when evaluating some aggregate
	queries).

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	If the error occurs creating a user table/index, the user should
	specify a smaller row width before attempting to create the
	table/index again. If the error is generated as a result of an
	internal request to create a temporary table, the user should report
	the problem to Ingres Corporation Technical Support.

 Parameters:
	%0c - the column being defined (or altered)

 Explanation:
	A non-numeric column may not use a numeric value as its default.
	Sequence values are always numeric and so cannot be used as
	a default for the column in question.

 System Status:
	The query will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Use a numeric column type.

E_US0851_2129:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - owner name
	%1c - table name

 Explanation:
	The user has explicitly referenced a table that is not accessible to
	them, because it is owned by a user who is none of: the current user,
	the DBA, or the system catalog owner. This message will not appear
	after release 6.4.

 System Status:
	The program continues; the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Reformulate the query so that it does not explicitly reference tables
	inaccessible to this user.

E_US086C_2156:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	none

 Explanation:
	The "first n" clause of the select statement can only be used on the
	first select of a query. It cannot be used on a subselect (in a 
	where clause), a union'ed select or the select of a "create view"
	statement.

 System Status:
	An error is returned for the query.  Any in-progress transactions are
	not aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Use the "first n" clause according to the defined syntax.

 Explanation:
	Order by clause elements must be either integer constants identifying
	an entry in the select list of the query, or an expression involving
	at least one column contained in the tables of the from clause. The
	permissible expressions may, of course, include a single column
	reference.

 System Status:
	An error is returned for the query.  Any in-progress transactions are
	not aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Code the order by list according to the syntax rules.

E_US0883_2179:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - line number
	%1c - column name

 Explanation:
	The column involved has a datatype which is designated as non-keyable.

 System Status:
	An error is returned for the query.  Any in-progress transactions are
	not aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Either use a keyable datatype for the column, or pick a different key.


E_US0884_2180:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - line number
	%1c - column name

 Explanation:
	The column involved has a datatype which is designated as non-keyable,
	which implicitly disqualifies the column for use in a secondary index.

 System Status:
	An error is returned for the query.  Any in-progress transactions are
	not aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Either pick a keyable datatype for the column (in the base table),
	or do not include this column in the secondary index.


E_US0885_2181:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - column name

 Explanation:
	The column involved has been specified in a "SORT", "ORDER BY"
	or "GROUP BY" clause, but the datatype for the column is not sortable.

 System Status:
	An error is returned for the query.  No in-progress transactions are
	aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Do not use the "SORT", "ORDER BY" or "GROUP BY" clause in conjunction 
	with this column.


E_US0886_2182:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0d - column position number

 Explanation:
	The column involved has been specified in a "SORT", "ORDER BY"
	or "GROUP BY" clause, but the datatype for the column is not sortable.

 System Status:
	An error is returned for the query.  No in-progress transactions are
	aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Do not use the "SORT", "ORDER BY" or "GROUP BY" clause in conjunction 
	with this column.


E_US088E_2190_INACCESSIBLE_TBL:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - query the user attempted to execute
	%1c - schema name
	%2c - table name

 Explanation:
	The table specified in the query does not exist or the user lacks some 
	required privileges on it.  "Required privileges" vary with the type of 
	the query. For example: for GRANT/REVOKE, grantor (or PUBLIC) must
	possess some privilege on the table; for SELECT, user (or PUBLIC) must 
	possess SELECT privilege on the table, etc.

	SQL92 tries to ensure that a user lacking privileges required to execute
	a statement should not be able to deduce any information about the 
	table from the error messages issued by the DBMS, which explains the
	vagueness of this message.

 System Status:
	If processing GRANT or REVOKE, the DBMS will attempt to process the
	next object, if any, named in the statement (this is our extension,
	as is the ability to name multiple objects in one statement).  For
	other statements, the statement will be rolled back.

 Recommendation:
	Verify that the table or view you specify in the statement exists and 
	that you possess all privileges required to execute the statement.


E_US088F_2191_INACCESSIBLE_EVENT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - query the user attempted to execute
	%1c - schema name
	%2c - dbevent name

 Explanation:
	The dbevent specified in the query does not exist or the user lacks
	some required privileges on it.  "Required privileges" vary with the
	type of query. For example: for GRANT/REVOKE, grantor (or PUBLIC) must 
	possess some privilege on the dbevent; for RAISE, user (or PUBLIC) must 
	possess RAISE privilege on the dbevent, etc.

	SQL92 tries to ensure that a user lacking privileges required to execute
	a statement should not be able to deduce any information about the 
	object from the error messages issued by the DBMS, which explains the
	vagueness of this message.

 System Status:
	If processing GRANT or REVOKE, the DBMS will attempt to process the
	next object, if any, named in the statement (this is our extension,
	as is the ability to name multiple objects in one statement).  For
	other statements, the statement will be rolled back.

 Recommendation:
	Verify that the dbevent you specify in the statement exists and 
	that you possess all privileges required to execute the statement.


E_US0890_2192_INACCESSIBLE_DBP:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - query the user attempted to execute
	%1c - schema name
	%2c - database procedure name

 Explanation:
	The database procedure specified in the query does not exist or the
	user lacks some required privileges on it.  "Required privileges" vary
	with the type of query. For example: for GRANT/REVOKE, grantor (or
	PUBLIC) must possess some privilege on the database procedure; for
	EXECUTE, user (or PUBLIC) must possess EXECUTE privilege on the
	database procedure, etc.

	SQL92 tries to ensure that a user lacking privileges required to execute
	a statement should not be able to deduce any information about the 
	object from the error messages issued by the DBMS, which explains the
	vagueness of this message.

 System Status:
	If processing GRANT or REVOKE, the DBMS will attempt to process the
	next object, if any, named in the statement (this is our extension,
	as is the ability to name multiple objects in one statement). For
	other statements, the statement will be rolled back.

 Recommendation:
	Verify that the database procedure you specify in the statement exists 
	and that you possess all privileges required to execute the statement.


E_US0891_2193_INACCESSIBLE_SEQ:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - query the user attempted to execute
	%1c - schema name
	%2c - sequence name

 Explanation:
	The sequence specified in the query does not exist or the user lacks
	some required privileges on it.  "Required privileges" vary with the
	type of query. For example: for GRANT/REVOKE, grantor (or PUBLIC) must 
	possess some privilege on the sequence; for RAISE, user (or PUBLIC) must 
	possess RAISE privilege on the sequence, etc.

	SQL92 tries to ensure that a user lacking privileges required to execute
	a statement should not be able to deduce any information about the

	next object, if any, named in the statement (this is our extension,
	as is the ability to name multiple objects in one statement).  For
	other statements, the statement will be rolled back.

 Recommendation:
	Verify that the sequence you specify in the statement exists and 
	that you possess all privileges required to execute the statement.

E_US08B2_2226:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - cursor name

 Explanation:
	The dynamically specified cursor name is not unique among currently
	open cursors.  It may be unique within the original source module,
	but it must also be unique within the current transaction.

 System Status:
	The "UPDATE/DELETE" statement is ignored; the cursor is left open.

 Recommendation:
	Modify the original "DECLARE CURSOR" statement to specify a unique
	cursor name if a dynamic "DELETE/UPDATE" statement will be issued.
	This restriction does not apply to static cursor "DELETE/UPDATE"
	statements.


E_US08B3_2227:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - table name as it appeared in DECLARE CURSOR
	%1c - table owner as determined in DECLARE CURSOR
	%2c - table name as specified in DELETE/UPDATE ... WHERE CURRENT OF...
	%3c - table owner as determined in DELETE/UPDATE ... WHERE CURRENT OF...

 Explanation:
	The name of the table and/or table owner as they were determined
	(note that owner name is optional) in "UPDATE/DELETE ... WHERE CURRENT
	OF ..." are different from those determined in "DECLARE CURSOR".

 System Status:
	The "UPDATE/DELETE" statement is ignored; the cursor is left open.

 Recommendation:
	Modify the "UPDATE/DELETE" statement to make sure that the names of
	the table and table owner are the same as they were determined in
	"DECLARE CURSOR".

	It is possible that the table which existed when "DECLARE CURSOR" was
	executed has since been dropped, in which case the user may consider
	some corrective action (e.g., redeclare the cursor to use an existing
	table).


E_US08B4_2228:SS25000_INV_XACT_STATE


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	Another cursor cannot be opened when no MST is in progress. The
	SQL user may have autocommit ON, which does not allow nested cursors.

 System Status:
	An error is returned for the query.

 Recommendation:
	For SQL, turn autocommit OFF;  QUEL users should put nested cursors
	inside an MST.


E_US08B5_2229:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement name
	%1c - cursor name

 Explanation:
	A non-updateable cursor was declared SCROLL KEYSET and this is not 
	permitted. The accompanying message describes why the cursor is
	considered non-updateable.

 System Status:
	An error is returned for the query.

 Recommendation:
	Modify the cursor to be updateable, or remove the KEYSET option.


E_US08B6_2230:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement number

 Explanation:
	A SCROLL cursor was declared FOR DEFERRED UPDATE. Updateable 
	scrollable cursors cannot use DEFERRED update.

 System Status:
	An error is returned for the query.

 Recommendation:
	Modify the cursor to be FOR DIRECT UPDATE or just remove the 
	DEFERRED option.


E_US08B7_2231:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement number
	%1c - cursor name

 Explanation:
	A SCROLL cursor contained a result column/expression of LOB type
	(CLOB, BLOB or NCLOB). This is not permitted, though LOB locators
	are acceptible.

 System Status:
	An error is returned for the query.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the LOB column/expression from the select list, or change
	it to use a LOB locator.


E_US08B8_2232:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement number
	%1c - cursor name

 Explanation:
	A SCROLL cursor with update/keyset options cannot be coded on a 
	Star database.

 System Status:
	An error is returned for the query.

 Recommendation:
	Remove update/keyset option or change to non-scrollable cursor.

E_US0906_2310:SS24000_INV_CURS_STATE


 Parameters:
	%0c - statement name
	%1c - cursor name

 Explanation:
	The statement was prepared from a cursor statement while the specified
	cursor was open.  By the time the statement was executed, the cursor
	was already closed.

 System Status:
	The "EXECUTE" statement is ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Only issue this statement while the cursor is open.  This statement
	may not apply to the same named cursor that is opened twice.  You
	must reprepare the statement to associate it with the correct cursor.

E_US0984_2436_RSER_TYPE:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The parameters to the "RAISE ERROR" procedure statement must be a
	non-nullable integer error number, optionally followed by a
	non-nullable error message string.

 System Status:
	The program continues, but the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Redeclare your "RAISE ERROR" parameters as the correct datatypes and
	with the NOT NULL attribute.


E_US0985_2437_RSER_NUL:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The parameters to the "RAISE ERROR" procedure statement must be a
	non-nullable integer error number, optionally followed by a
	non-nullable error message string.

 System Status:
	Program continues and current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Redeclare your "RAISE ERROR" parameters with the NOT NULL attribute.


E_US0986_2438_EXEC_COL:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - column name or correlation name

 Explanation:
	Values in the "EXECUTE PROCEDURE" target list may be literal values,
	some symbolic constants (such as USER and NULL) and, when the
	statement is nested within a database procedure, a local variable
	or parameter.  A value such as:

	        EXECUTE PROCEDURE p (a = table.col)

	is invalid as the meaning is ambiguous (is this a full column
	aggregate or the column value of "some current row".

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted.  If the statement is nested within
	a database procedure, the procedure creation is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the value usage.


E_US0987_2439_EXEC_TYPE:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - result variable name

 Explanation:
	The result datatype of any procedure is INTEGER.  All variables
	and parameters that are to retrieve the result of a procedure (via
	the "result_variable =" clause) must be declared as INTEGER.

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted.  If the statement is nested within
	a database procedure, the procedure creation is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the datatype of the specified variable or parameter.


E_US0988_2440_SEL_CNTA_FROM:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


E_US0989_2441_TTAB_PARM:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


E_US098A_2442_RULE_PROC:SS50000_MISC_ERRORS


 Parameters:
      %0c - procedure name.

 Explanation:
      A row level rule triggers the invocation of a procedure with a
      SET OF parameter. Only statement level rules may invoke SET OF
      procedures.

 System Status:
      PSF will reject the query.

 Recommendation:
      Either the rule must be changed to be statement level, or the
      procedure must be recoded to use a simple (non-SET OF) parameter
      list.

E_US098F_2447_ROWPROC_NODYN:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
      %0c - procedure name.

 Explanation:
      A row producing procedure was executed using dynamic SQL or by
	a nested call from within another procedure. Row producing
	procedures may only be called from a ESQL program using a 
	static EXECUTE PROCEDURE statement.

 System Status:
      QEF will reject the query.

E_US0A92_2706:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	The scanner encountered the end of the query buffer while trying to
	read a delimited identifier.  This error can be caused by a missing
	closing double-quote.

E_US0A9A_2714:SS42506_INVALID_IDENTIFIER


 Parameters:
	%0c - delimited identifier name

 Explanation:
	The delimited identifier being read exceeds the maximum length
	defined for an identifier.

 System Status:
	The query is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the error and reenter.


E_US0A9B_2715:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0d - line number of query
	%1c - token causing error (in this case, a single-quoted identifier)

 Explanation:
	This error is returned when trace point PS251 is turned on,
	in order to help DBMS tools and users remove single-quoted
	identifiers from their applications.
	
	Support for single-quoted identifiers is being deprecated for most
	statements, including:
		o CREATE/ALTER/DROP GROUP '<group>'
		o CREATE GROUP ... WITH USERS = ('<user>')
		o ALTER GROUP ... ADD USERS ('<user>')
		o ALTER GROUP ... DROP USERS ('<user>')
		o CREATE/ALTER/DROP ROLE '<role>'
		o GRANT ... TO [USER|GROUP|ROLE] '<authid>'
	
	Single-quoted identifiers were never documented for these
	statements, and users can now use delimited identifiers instead.

	NOTE: Single-quoted identifiers are still allowed in the following
	statements/clauses: 
	     REGISTER .. AS LINK
	        [FROM [[']local_owner_name['].][']local_table_name[']]
	     CREATE TABLE ..  
	        [WITH TABLE = [[']local_owner_name['].][']local_table_name[']]
	     4GL CONNECT statements
	
 System Status:
	The query is rejected.

 Recommendation:
	Replace single-quote delimiters with double-quote delimiters, and retry.

E_US0B57_2903:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0d  - line number of script the error occurred in
	%1c  - function name

 Explanation:
	A function was coded in a SQL statement with an incorrect number 
	of parameters. 

 System Status:
	The program continues, but the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the function specification.


E_US0B58_2904:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - datatype of supplied value

 Explanation:
	A language variable contained a value of a type other than string type
	(i.e., C, CHAR, TEXT, VARCHAR, LONGTEXT), which is the only type
	appropriate for the current context.

	This message will be returned, for instance, if a user were to supply an
	integer variable in place of <escape character> of a <like predicate>.

 System Status:
	The program continues, but the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement and reenter.


E_US0B59_2905:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	In this statement, an expression in the target list must be a numeric
	literal in order for it to be preceded by a unary plus or minus.  This
	is likely to occur in a statement that does not allow expressions in
	its target lists.

 System Status:
	The program continues, but the current statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	If this is a syntax error, correct the error.  If your program
	requires the unary operator on a dynamic value, then either calculate
	the negative value prior to the use of the value, or consider delaying
	the assumption that the value is negative until later in the program.

	%0c - option name

 Explanation:
	A post-6.4 syntax error was found while parsing column qualifications
	in a "CREATE TABLE" statement. This error message is used instead of

 Recommendation:

E_US1011_4113:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - attribute qualifier

 Explanation:
	A post-6.4 syntax error was found while parsing column qualifications
	in a "CREATE TABLE" statement.  This error message is used instead of
	error #2004.
	
	The accepted syntax diagram for the column qualifier clause is:

	    '[with | not null] [not | with system_maintained]
	      [with default | not default | [with] default <value>]
	      [UNIQUE | PRIMARY KEY] [REFERENCES <table>(<col_list>)]
	      [CHECK (<boolean_expr>)]'

	with two exceptions. It is not allowed to specify "not default",
	"with null", or "default <value>" in conjunction with the
	"with system_maintained" qualifier.

	The order of these qualifiers is no longer significant (as of 6.5).
	The following is a complete list of accepted attribute qualifiers
	(a few options, although syntactically correct per the above syntax
	diagram, are disallowed due to the "with system_maintained"
	restrictions): 
	
	        with null
	        not  null
	        with null with default
	        with null [with] default <value>
	        with null not default
	        not  null with default
	        not  null [with] default <value>
	        not  null not default
	        not  null with default with system_maintained
	        with null not system_maintained
	        not  null with default not system_maintained
	        not  null not default not system_maintained
	        with system_maintained
	        not  system_maintained
	        not  null UNIQUE
	        not  null PRIMARY KEY

	"REFERENCES" and "CHECK" clauses can be used with any of these.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Reissue the "CREATE" statement after correcting the problem with
	the attribute qualifier clause.

 Explanation:
	The specified rule was removed from the system catalogs, but the table
	referenced by the rule (in the original "CREATE RULE" statement) no
	longer exists.  This could occur due to direct removal of the table
	from the system catalogs without using the "DROP TABLE" statement or
	issuing the "DROP TABLE" statement through an older version of the
	software.

 System Status:
	The rule is dropped, and the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Verify that the rule no longer exists, and that the table referenced by

	are defined could become inconsistent.  This includes SQL92 Constraints
	(internal rules and procedures for CHECK and REFERENTIAL constraints,
	internal indexes for UNIQUE constraints) and Views WITH CHECK OPTION
	(internal rule and internal procedure).

 System Status:
	The current statement is aborted; the program continues.

 Recommendation:
	Don't attempt to drop this object. If this object really must be
	dropped, drop the constraint or view for which it was created.  This
	object will then be dropped automatically.

	through a view created "WITH CHECK OPTION" which constitutes a CHECK
	OPTION violation.

 System Status:
	The current statement is rolled back.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the query so that it does not result in creation of rows that
	are no longer visible through a view created "WITH CHECK OPTION", or
	reformulate it so it no longer involves a view "WITH CHECK OPTION" for
	which has been violated by the query.

E_US1931_6449_PARTITION_BADOPT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


E_US1932_6450_PARTITION_NOTALLOWED:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


E_US1933_6451_PART_TOOMANY:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


E_US1934_6452_PART_BADCOL:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


E_US1935_6453_PART_BADCOLTYPE:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c - Query name containing PARTITION definition
	%1c - Column name

 Explanation:
	Some datatypes, such as LONG VARCHAR, are marked as non-sortable
	or non-keyable.  Any column used as a partitioning column must be
	an ordinary sortable datatype.  LIST and RANGE distributions also
	exclude logical key and BIT datatypes.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Choose a different column for a partitioning column.


E_US1936_6454_PART_NNAMES:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - The query name
	%1d - The number of partitions to be defined
	%2d - The number of names listed

 Explanation:
	AUTOMATIC and HASH partitions are defined using a PARTITION
	clause of the form:  nn PARTITIONS (name, ...)  where either
	the number of partitions nn, or the name list, or both may
	be omitted.  The number of partitions defaults to 1.  If
	the name list is not omitted entirely, a name must be listed
	for every partition to be defined.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	List the same number of names as the number of partitions nn,
	or omit the name list entirely and allow names to be generated
	by the system.


E_US1937_6455_PART_VALTOOLONG:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - The query name
	%1c - The distribution rule for this partitioning dimension
	%2c - The start of the constant
	%3c - The partitioning column
	%4d - The maximum allowed length

 Explanation:
	The partitioning system catalogs have a fixed maximum
	size for storing LIST or RANGE partitioning constants.
	A constant larger than that size cannot be used as
	a partitioning constant, as it cannot be stored.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Use a shorter partitioning constant.  For RANGE, use
	a leading portion of the string constant rather than the
	entire string.


E_US1938_6456_PART_VALTYPE:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


E_US1939_6457_PART_VALCOUNT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR

E_US1943_6461_NOT_SUBPART:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - The query name
	%1c - This logical partition name
	%2c - The preceding logical partition name

 Explanation:
	When specifying a particular logical partition with the
	PARTITION logpart.logpart... syntax, the logical partition names
	must occur in order by increasing dimension (that is, from outer
	dimensions towards inner dimensions).

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	List the logical partition names in the proper order.


E_US1944_6462_STRUCTURE_REQ:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


E_US1945_6463_LPART_NOTALLOWED:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - The query name
	%1c - The operation or WITH-option in question

 Explanation:
	The query has specified one or more specific logical partitions,
	using the table PARTITION partition-name syntax;  but the operation
	or WITH-option must operate on an entire table, not part of a
	table.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Either list just the table name, or choose a different operation
	or WITH-option.


E_US1946_6464_PPART_ONLY:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


E_US1947_6465_X_NOTWITH_Y:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - The query name

 Explanation:
	The query has specified a combination of operations or options
	that is not allowed.

E_US1948_6466_UNIQUE_PART_INCOMPAT:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - The query name

 Explanation:
	When a UNIQUE storage structure is applied to a partitioned table,
	Ingres requires that the uniqueness checking be local to each
	partition.  If rows with a given storage structure key might be
	located in more than one partition, uniqueness cannot be enforced
	via the storage structure.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Make the partitioning columns equal to (or a subset of) the
	desired storage structure key.
	Or, enforce uniqueness with a global index, or a UNIQUE constraint.


E_US1949_6467_PART_TOOMANYP:SS42000_SYN_OR_ACCESS_ERR


 Parameters:
	%0c - The query name
	%1d - The number of physical partitions requested
	%2d - The maximum number allowed

 Explanation:
	The number of physical partitions is the product of the number
	of partitions in each dimension of your partitioning scheme.
	There is a maximum number of physical partitions allowed by
	this version of Ingres, and your partitioning scheme exceeds it.

 System Status:
	The query is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Revise your partition definition so that fewer physical partitions
	are required.


E_US1964_6500:SS42503_INSUF_PRIV


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	For a B1 secure installation, any operation which alters the state of 
	an object will be rejected if the current subject label (user label)
	does not exactly match the label associated with the object.
	For example, if you created a table with a security label of
	"unclassified", you cannot modify the table if you are currently
	running at top-secret, even though a top-secret user can see
	unclassified data.  This is part of our B1 security model.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user should log in with the correct security label, and re-issue
	the operation.


E_US1965_6501:SS42503_INSUF_PRIV


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	For a B1 secure installation, any operation which alters the state 
	of a row will be rejected if the user does not have appropriate 
	privileges or the new label would be invalid for the indicated database.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	The user should log in with the correct security label, and re-issue
	the operation.


E_US1966_6502:SS42503_INSUF_PRIV


 Parameters:
	None.

 Explanation:
	A row security label must dominate the label of the table in
	which it occurs.

 System Status:
	The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Label the row so that it dominates the table label.


E_US1967_6503_DEF_PRIVS_NSUB:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
	 None.

 Explanation:
	When issing a "CREATE/ALTER USER/PROFILE" statement, the full

	Make sure all default privileges are included in the full privileges.


E_US1968_6504_UNOPRIV_WDEFAULT:SS5000A_QUERY_ERROR


 Parameters:
       None.

 Explanation:
	When issing a "CREATE/ALTER USER" statement, noprivileges and 
	'with profile' been specified but nodefault_privilege has not been
	included, this is ambiguous, as the profile may contain 
	default_privileges, which the user will get and we wish user should
	have no privileges. 

 System Status:
      The statement is aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Specify -nodefault_privileges, specification with -noprivileges, for 
	create user statement, where profile is specified.

	recognized, and then correct the variable or local procedure declaration


E_W40028	"Duplicate constant declaration.\n


 Explanation:
	The frame or 4GL procedure already has a field, table field, hidden
	field or constant with the same name as the constant that is being
	defined.  Because this is ambiguous, the constant cannot have this name.

 System Status:
	The definition of this constant will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Use a different name for the constant.


E_W40029	"Declared procedure name mis-match.\n



 Explanation:
	The name of the procedure defined in ABF does not match the name
	of the procedure syntactically specified in the 4GL source code
	for the procedure.  (That is, as "procedure <name> ...".)

 System Status:
	4GL will terminate.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the name of the procedure as defined in ABF matches the
	name of the procedure specified in the 4GL source code file.


E_W40030	"Syntax error on line '%0d'.  Unexpected End-Of-File."


E_W40031	"Unterminated comment."


 Explanation:
	The 4GL scanner detected a comment (beginning with "/*") that was not
	terminated (by a "* /"; note: no space) before the End-of-File was seen.
	This usually means you forgot or mis-typed the comment terminator
	character sequence.

 System Status:
	4GL could not determine where the comment ended and assumed the rest
	of the source file was a comment.  Since no more lines can be compiled,
	the compilation will be terminated with an error status.

 Recommendation:
	Insert the comment termination sequence "* /" (note:  no space) at the
	appropriate place after the comment that caused the error.  Then compile
	the source file.


E_W40032	"Unterminated string constant (strings cannot span lines.)"


 Explanation:
	You probably forgot to terminate the string with a string delimiter
	character.  Strings cannot contain embedded new-lines.  The string on
	this line must be terminated with a string delimiter character also on
	this line.

 System Status:
	The string will be terminated at the new-line and parsing will continue.
	This may inadvertently result in spurious errors being recognized.  The
	source file will not be compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Terminate the string with a string delimiter character.  Or, if you
	want a new-line to be embedded in the string, use text notation ('\n')
	in 4GL/QUEL, or use hexadecimal specification (X'0C', ASCII) in 4GL/SQL.
	Then compile the source file.


E_W40033	"String constant too long for 4GL.  The limit is 253,


E_W40034	"Bad number '%0c' in ERROR comment."	/* DIAG */


E_W40035	"Bad number '%0c' in LINE comment."	/* DIAG */


E_W40036	"Bad number '%0c' in special comment."	/* DIAG */


E_W40037	"Warning:  Strings delimited by double-quotes (\") are


 Explanation:
	4GL/SQL no longer supports strings delimited by double-quotes (").

 System Status:
	The string will be converted to a single-quote string if it contains
	only printable characters or a hexadecimal string if it does not.  No
	error will be generated.

 Recommendation:
	Use single-quotes (') to delimit strings or use the hexadecimal
	notation in 4GL/SQL.


E_W40038	"String constant is too long for 4GL.  The limit is 253,


E_W40039	"Invalid single-quote on line '%0d.'\n


E_W40040	"Hexadecimal string constant is too long for 4GL.  The limit


E_W40041	"An invalid character was used in a hexadecimal string constant


E_W40042	"Hexadecimal string constants must contain an even number of


E_W40050_BadDecimal   "A bad value was given in II_4GL_DECIMAL.\n


 Explanation:
    The character given in II_4GL_DECIMAL is not a valid decimal point
    character.  This is the character you have used in 4GL source
    statements to specify numeric literals that can have a fractional part,
    such as money values or real numbers.  Valid decimal point characters
    are '.' or ','.  Important note: this logical symbol is provided
    only for backward compatibility.  It is recommended that you use
    a decimal point character of '.' in your 4GL source code,
    and leave II_4GL_DECIMAL unset (it will default to '.').

 System Status:
    The 4GL compiler will assume that your 4GL statements will use
    a decimal point character of '.' to specify the fractional parts
    of numeric literals.  If your 4GL statements in fact use some other
    character, a syntax error will be reported.

 Recommendation:
    Set a valid single-character string for the II_4GL_DECIMAL name.


E_W400F0	"Syntax error.  The last symbol read was '%0c'."

E_W40107	"Operation specification not recognized in this context.\n


E_W40108	"Missing block for query loop.\n


E_W40109	"Warning:  Not an Open SQL command.\n


 Explanation:
	When the '-wopen' flag is given to ABF, the 4GL/SQL compiler will
	produce warning messages when it encounters statements that are not
	part of the Open SQL specification.

 System Status:
	None.

 Recommendation:
	If you want to build applications to be used on heterogeneous DBMS
	systems using an INGRES/Gateway, you should not use any statements
	that produce this warning message.


E_W4010D_STACK_OVERFLOW "The 4GL parser's stack overflowed.\n


 Explanation:
	The 4GL compiler's internal parser stack overflowed.
	This resulted from 4GL language constructs that were nested too deeply.

 System Status:
	The 4GL compilation will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Change the logic of the application so that constructs
	are not nested so deeply.  Here are some recommendations:
	(a) Make sure that each BEGIN has a matching END, each IF has a
	    matching ENDIF, each left parenthesis has a matching right
	    parenthesis, and so forth.
	(b) Break up complex expressions into simpler expressions,
	    using variables to hold intermediate results.


E_W40110	"An assignment statement had incompatible types between


E_W40111 "Warning:  Nullable expression assigned to non-Nullable variable.\n


E_W40112	"Operands acted on by the operator '%0c'


 Explanation:
	An expression specified an operation on two or more operands that had
	incompatible or illegal types for such an operation.  For example, a
	date and a number are incompatible types and cannot be compared using
	any of the relational operators such as '='.  Or as another example,
	strings are illegal operands for any operator but '+'.

 System Status:
	Neither the expression nor the source file will be compiled, but
	the source file will be checked for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the operation.


E_W40113	"An operand acted on by the operator


 Explanation:
	An expression specified a unary operation on an operand that had an
	illegal type for such an operation.  For example, the unary minus
	operation cannot be applied to any but a numeric or money operand.

 System Status:
	Neither the expression nor the source file will be compiled, but
	the source file will be checked for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the operation.


E_W40114	"An operand acted on by the logical


 Explanation:
	A logical expression specified a logical operation (either AND, OR or
	NOT) on an operand (expression) that was not a boolean type.  Boolean
	expressions are either other logical expressions or an expression
	specifying a comparison operation (e.g., "<=" or "like".)

 System Status:
	Neither the logical expression nor the source file will be compiled,
	but the source file will be checked for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the logical expression.


E_W40115	"The undefined symbol '%0c' was referenced


E_W40116	"Undefined table field '%0c'.\n


E_W40117	"Undefined column '%2c'.\n


E_W40118	"The symbol '%0c' is undefined."


E_W40119	"The field or column used in an assignment


E_W4011A	"The symbol '%0c' was used in an assignment statement


 Explanation:
	The symbol being assigned to in an assignment statement (on the
	left-hand side of the assignment operator, '=' or ':=') is a constant
	or a table.  Constants have a single (constant) value assigned to them
	by definition and cannot have other values assigned to them.  Tables
	can not have values assigned in this way.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that the symbol being assigned to represents a field or
	column and then compile the source file.


E_W4011B	"Warning:  Superfluous use of ':' to dereference a field


 Explanation:
	The field or column being assigned to is superfluously dereferenced by
	':'.  In some contexts such as when accessing the DBMS or the Forms
	System, 4GL expects symbols to represent names rather than values.  But
	within that context, 4GL also allows reference to be made to a value
	that will contain the name by allowing use of the dereference indicator,
	':'.  Assignments, however, always unambiguously refer to fields or
	columns on the form and should not be dereferenced by ':'.

 System Status:
	4GL will ignore the superfluous ':' and continue compiling the source
	file.

 Recommendation:
	Edit the source file and remove any superfluous ':'.


E_W4011C	"Operands passed to the function '%0c'


 Explanation:
	An expression specified an internal built-in function operating on zero
	or more operands that had illegal types or were incorrect in number for
	such a function.  For example, the 'length()' function operates on
	exactly one argument of a string type, no more, no less.

 System Status:
	Neither the expression nor the source file will be compiled, but
	the source file will be checked for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the function call.


E_W4011D "Warning:  Possible Null used when a non-Null value is required.\n


E_W4011E	"Illegal operand passed to a function."


 Explanation:
	A function was called with an illegal operand.  For example, 
	a table field may have been passed to a host-language procedure.

 System Status:
	Neither the expression nor the source file will be compiled, but
	the source file will be checked for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the function call.


 Explanation:
	A field or column that is of Nullable type was used in a context that
	will not recognize a Null value if the field or column should contain
	one.  Such contexts include form or field names, etc.  4GL warns about
	these cases because if a Null value happens to be used here at runtime
	an error will occur and further behavior of the application may be
	unpredictable.

 System Status:
	The 4GL frame or procedure will be compiled assuming no other errors
	occur.  However, if by chance at runtime a Null value is placed in
	the variable and it is used in this context, a runtime error will be
	reported and the statement will be aborted with unpredictable results.

 Recommendation:
	Define the field or column to be NOT NULL.  Null values are illegal in
	this context so the field or column (usually a hidden one) should be
	non-Nullable.


E_W40120	"An expression or value of a character type is required in


 Explanation:
	4GL requires a string-valued expression in the context being translated,
	e.g., as the 'message' for a message statement.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement.


E_W40121	"A expression or value of integer type is required,


E_W402CD	"A FOR loop variable must be of integer type and non-nullable."


E_W40122	"A string or integer reference is required in


 Explanation:
	
 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement.


E_W40123	"A string value or field or column reference of


 Explanation:
	4GL requires a string value in the specified context.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that a string value is specified in the required context
	and then compile the source file.

E_W4012E	"The type of the return value is incompatible with that


E_W4012F	"Warning:  No return value.  The frame or procedure


 Explanation:
	A return statement with no return value was recognized in the source for
	a frame or procedure that was defined as returning a value.  Although a
	default value will be returned, it is likely that you forgot to return
	a value for the frame or procedure.  Also possible is that you defined
	the frame or procedure as returning a value when no values should ever
	be returned for it.

 System Status:
	Compilation will continue with no errors.  At run-time a default value
	will be returned for the frame or procedure.

 Recommendation:
	Always explicitly return a value for frames or procedures that have been
	defined as returning a value.  Or, if the frame or procedure is not
	supposed to return values, define it as such.

E_W40134_BadWithNull


 Explanation:
      Correct syntax is: copy table <tblname> (<colname> = <format>
                              with null (<value>) ...)
      where <value> can be a number if <format> is numeric or a hex
      constant like X'393939' for the string '999' or a quoted string
      constant like 'NULL'. An unquoted string is not allowed.

 System Status:
      The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
      compiled.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the syntax error and re-compile the source file.

E_W40158	"Too many attached queries in a parameter list.\n


 Explanation:
	At the moment, 4GL only supports passing a single query (master-detail
	or otherwise) as a parameter to a 4GL frame.  More than one such query
	was specified in the parameter list for the CALLFRAME statement being
	compiled and is an error.

 System Status:
	Additional query parameters will be ignored, and although the source
	file will be checked for other errors, it will not be compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Change the parameter list so that it contains only one query and then
	compile the source file.


E_W40159	"Non-existent query object, '%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	A query object was expected either as the target of an assignment
	(on the left-hand side) or as a value list (as part of a ".all")
	in a query statement.  The name used to refer to the query object
	is not the name of the form or of a table field on the form, which
	are the only defined query objects for a frame or procedure.

 System Status:
	The query statement will be ignored, and although the source file will
	be checked for other errors, it will not be compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the name to be a defined query object and then compile the file.


E_W40170	"Duplicate label definition.\n


 Explanation:
	The frame or 4GL procedure already has a label with the same name
	as the label that is being defined at this point.  Because this is
	ambiguous, you should use a different name for this label.

 System Status:
	The definition of this label will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Use a different name for the label.


E_W40171	"Undefined label.\n


 Explanation:
	The label referenced in an ENDLOOP statement was not defined for any
	of the WHILE, UNLOADTABLE, or query loops active at this point in the
	source code.  Labels must be defined for an active loop at the point
	where they are referenced by an ENDLOOP statement.

 System Status:
	The ENDLOOP statement will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the name refers to a defined and active label, and then
	compile the source file.


E_W40172	"The loop with label '%0c'


 Explanation:
	The label referenced in an ENDLOOP statement was defined for a WHILE,
	UNLOADTABLE, or query loop that is no longer active at this point in
	the source code.  Labels must be defined for an active loop at the point
	where they are referenced by an ENDLOOP statement.

 System Status:
	The ENDLOOP statement will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the name refers to a defined and active label, and then
	compile the source file.


E_W40173	"The '%0c' statement is not allowed


 Explanation:
	Certain statements in 4GL implicitly assume that a form is associated
	with the object being compiled.  Since forms can never be associated
	with procedures, the presence of these statements in a procedure is
	recognized as an error.

 System Status:
	The statement will be ignored, and although the 4GL procedure will
	be checked for other errors, it will not be compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the unsupported statements from the procedure
	and then compile the source file for the procedure.


E_W40175	"ENDLOOP can only be used within an unloadtable or


E_W40176	"UNLOADTABLE statements cannot be nested."


E_W40177	"Warning:  Hidden columns are not defined for table fields


E_W40178	"Illegal character in text string.\n


 Explanation:
	The character '\0' was specified in a TEXT string constant in the
	source file being compiled.  Character strings of type TEXT cannot
	contain the character '\0' (the zero bit pattern.)  A more complete
	discussion of this can be found in the INGRES Reference Manual.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the character '\0' from the TEXT string constant and
	then compile the source file.


E_W40179	"A qualification cannot appear in this statement."


E_W4017A	"Invalid field '%0c' in qualification.\n


 Explanation:
	The named hidden field was listed as a qualification predicate.  Since
	hidden fields are not known to the Forms System, they cannot contain
	both operators and values as can visible fields in query mode.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the hidden field from the qualification predicate.  (Where
	clauses can be built in a string variable to implement dynamic queries.
	Please consult the 4GL Reference Manual for details.)

 Explanation:
	This is a warning message that is produced when a 5.0 transaction
	statement is found in oslsql code in release 6.

	The user should modify their code to follow 6.0 sql transaction
	semantics or use the SET AUTOCOMMIT option to maintain 5.0 semantics.


E_W40230	"Warning: The class name '%0c' is undefined in the database\n


 Explanation:
	4GL saw a name it thought was a class name, but it couldn't find
	the class name in the database.  4GL will continue as if the name
	is a class, assuming that the class will be defined by the time
	this 4GL code is executed.

 System Status:
	4GL will continue.

 Recommendation:
	Be sure to define the class before executing the application.


E_W40231	"Variable '%0c' used in a method invocation is not an object.\n


 Explanation:
	A variable was used in a method invocation, yet the variable was
	not an object reference.

 System Status:
	The 4GL parsing will still continue, but will exit with an error.

 Recommendation:
	Check the type of the variable you are using in the method 
	invocation.  It must be an object reference.


E_W40232	"The method '%0c' is not defined for this class.\n


 Parameters:
	0: This is the name of the method that the user tried to 
	   invoke on an object.

 Explanation:
	A method that 4GL does not know about was used.

 System Status:
	4GL will continue to compile the code, but the error must
	be fixed before the code can be run.

 Recommendation:
	Check the definition of the class of the object to find out
	the legal methods, and also check the spelling of the method.


E_W40233	"Attribute '%0c' is unknown for the class.\n


 Explanation:
	An attribute that 4GL does not know about was used.

E_W4024E_CAST_NOTARRAY "Attempt to assign a non-array value to an array variable.\n


 Parameters
	0	The name of the class of the array. For example, if

	the variable.  In this case, the value is a superclass of
	the variable.  It is possible that at runtime, the value might
	contain a value that is the same class or a subclass of the
	variable, so the compiler is issuing a warning and then adding
	a cast to make sure the value is legal.

 System Status:
	The 4GL code will compile successfully, but a runtime error
	might be reported.

 Recommendation:
	Check the code to make sure the runtime check will succeed.


E_W40251_CAST_ERROR	"'%1c' is not a subclass of '%0c'.\n


 Parameters:
	0	The name of the class of the variable.

	1	The name of the class of the value.

 Explanation:
	A value is being assigned to a reference variable.  For this
	to be legal, the value must be the same class or a subclass of
	the variable.  In this case, the class of the value is a not related in
	anyway to the class of the variable, so this assignment is illegal.

 System Status:
	The 4GL code will not compile successfully.

 Recommendation:
	Fix the statement so the class of the right side is
	a subclass of the left side.


E_W40252_OBJECT_DBMS	"Reference or array variable used in a DBMS statement.\n


 Parameters:
	0	The name of the variable.

 Explanation:
	The only 4GL variables that can be used in a DBMS statement
	are those declared with a simple type (e.g. Integer, Float, Varchar,
	Date and Money).  In this case a variable whose type is some
	kind of object (i.e. it is a reference or array variable) was
	used in a DBMS statement.  This is illegal.

 System Status:
	The 4GL code will not compile successfully.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the use of this variable from the DBMS statement.


E_W40253_BadRepeat    "Warning: query is not repeatable.\n


 Explanation:
 	The or REPEATED keyword was specified on a query.
 	However, the query contains a variable reference in a context
	which is not proper for a repeated query.  Examples of such
	improper contexts are using a string variable to specify an entire
	WHERE clause or to specify the name of a DBMS object (such as a
	table or column).

 System Status:
    	The REPEATED specification will be ignored. Compilation will continue.

 Recommendation:
    	If you want the query to be repeatable, use a literal in place of
   	the variable reference.  If you want to retain the variable reference
      (thereby forcing the query to be marked non-repeatable), no action
  	is necessary (but you might want to remove the REPEATED
   	keyword so that the 4GL source file reflects what will actually occur,
      and so that subsequent compilations won't get the warning message).


E_W40254_ALLOCREF_ERR	"An error occurred while preparing to compile scripts.  The most probable cause is that internal state information were not setup correctly"


 Explanation:
	Windows4gl had problems setting up to compile scripts.  This is
	just a warning.

 System Status:
	Windows4gl will try to continue running.

 Recommendation:
	User can't do much since this is an internal error.


E_W40255_CONT_STMT	"CONTINUE statement with no active loop"


E_W40256_CONT_LOOP	"Can only continue a loop statement"


E_W40257_NO_QUERY_IN_WITH	"A query can not appear in a with clause"


E_W40258_NO_ALL_IN_WITH	"A .all or * can not appear in a with clause"


E_W402E3_TOO_MANY_PARMS		"Too many parameters.\n


 Explanation:
	More than 255 parameters were specified on an invocation of a
	frame, procedure, or method.

 System Status:
	The 4GL code will not compile successfully.

 Recommendation:
	Reduce the number of parameters.  You may wish to create a user class
	which represents a set of parameters.  Then you can populate it
	and pass it as a single parameter.


E_W40259_UPDATE_NOUPD_CURSOR	"FOR UPDATE given with non-updatable cursor."


E_W4025A_FROM_NEEDED	"A from clause must be given with an updatable cursor"


E_W4025B_NO_REPEAT_CURSORS	"repeated cursors are not supported."


E_W4025C_NO_CORRELATION_VAR	"The cursor DELETE statement may not contain a correlation variable"


E_W4025D_NO_CUR_DEL_AS_REPEAT	"The cursor DELETE statement may not be a repeated query"


E_W4025E_NO_CORR_VAR_IN_UPD	"The cursor UPDATE statement may not contain a correlation variable"


E_W4025F_NO_UPD_AS_REPEAT	"The cursor UPDATE statement may not be a repeated query"


E_W40260_NO_FROM_IN_UPDATE	"The cursor UPDATE statement may not contain a FROM clause"


E_W402C3_VAR_NOT_CURSOROBJ	"Variable used in cursor %0c statement is not a Cursorobject.\n"


E_W40262_CANT_RECOV_ERRORS "The 4GL compiler can't recover from earlier errors."


 Explanation:
	The 4GL compiler encountered an error in the 4GL source file from which
	it could not recover.  The error is somewhere near the end of the
	portion of the 4GL source file that appears in the error listing,
	and has already been described by a previous error message.

 System Status:
	The 4GL compilation will be aborted.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the errors that were described by previous error messages.


E_W40265_BAD_EVENT_NAME	"Bad event name or incorrect type of object for event."


E_W40266_DUP_EVENT_SPEC	"A duplicate event specification for the same object was used in an ON EVENT"


E_W402C4_ERR_DECL_VAR	"Error declaring variable %0c.\n"


E_W40268_NOT_NULL_ARRAY	"A NOT NULL clause can not be given with an array or reference variable declaration.  All array and reference variables are nullable."


E_W40269_LEN_SPEC_NOT_ALLOW	"A length specification (e.g., (10)) can not be given with an array or reference variable declaration.  Remove the length specification."


E_W402C5_ERR_DECL_PROC	"Error declaring local procedure %0c.\n"


E_W402C6_MisplacedProcDecl "Misplaced local procedure declaration.\n


 Explanation:
	Local procedure declarations should appear in the DECLARE section
	in the INITIALIZE statement or in a field script (if they're used by
	a frame), or in the DECLARE section in a procedure (if they're used by
	that procedure).

 System Status:
	The local procedure declaration will be processed anyway.
	The error, however, is fatal.  (In future releases, a local procedure
	declaration as a parameter may have a different meaning).

 Recommendation:
	Move the local procedure declaration into the DECLARE section.


E_W402C7_NestedLocalProc	"A local procedure may not be declared


 Explanation:
	A local procedure may not be declared inside another local procedure.

 System Status:
	The statement will be processed, but the compilation will not succeed.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the declaration, or move it into the declarations
	for the main frame or procedure.


E_W402C8_ProcNotDecl	"Procedure not declared.\n


 Explanation:
	The name specified in the definition of a local procedure
	has not yet appeared in any local procedure declaration.
	A local procedure must be declared before it's defined.

 System Status:
	A declaration of PROCEDURE RETURNING NONE is assumed.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the procedure is declared before it's defined.


E_W402C9_DupProcDefn	"Duplicate procedure definition.\n


 Explanation:
	The name of the procedure specified in a local procedure definition
	has already appeared in an earlier local procedure definition.

 System Status:
	The 4GL compiler will examine the procedure definition
	for further errors.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the name of the procedure is unique.


E_W402CA_ProcNotDefn	"Procedure not defined.\n


 Explanation:
	The name specified in a local procedure declaration
	never appeared in any local procedure definition.
	Each local procedure must be declared and defined exactly once.

 System Status:
	A fatal error is reported.

 Recommendation:
	Change the 4GL source program to define the procedure,
	or remove the declaration of the procedure and all references to it.


E_W402CB_CANT_ADD_CUROBJ_VAR	"The variable %0c could not be declared.\n


 Explanation:
	The compiler was unable to declare a variable representing
	the current frame, procedure, field script, or event block.
	The can occur for CurFrame if a field in the form is also named
	CurFrame.

 System Status:
	A fatal error is reported.

 Recommendation:
	If the error occurs for the variable CurFrame or CurrentFrame,
	and there is field in the form that's named CurFrame or CurrentFrame,
	change the name of the field in the form.
	Otherwise, contact Technical Support.


E_W402CC_ProcDeclInEventBlock "Misplaced local procedure declaration.\n


 Explanation:
	Local procedure declarations should appear in the DECLARE section
	in the INITIALIZE statement or in a field script (if they're used by
	a frame), or in the DECLARE section in a procedure (if they're used by
	that procedure).

 System Status:
	The local procedure declaration will be processed anyway.
	The error, however, is fatal.  (In future releases, a local procedure
	declaration as a parameter may have a different meaning).

 Recommendation:
	Move the local procedure declaration into the DECLARE section for
	the field script or frame.


E_W402CE_PROC_DEFAULT_VALUE


 Explanation:
      A local procedure declarations can not define a default value.

 System Status:
      The default value definition will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
      Remove the default value definition.


E_W402CF_REDUNDANT_WITH_CLAUSE


 Explanation:
      A declaration can contain only one WITH clause to define
	nullability or a default.  If two appear, this message results.

 System Status:
      The compilation will fail.

 Recommendation:
      Remove the superfluous WITH clause.


E_W402D0_EMPTY_DEFAULT_CLAUSE


 Explanation:
      A declaration which contains a DEFAULT clause must specify a default
	of some kind.  None is specified here.

 System Status:
      The compilation will fail.

 Recommendation:
      Remove the DEFAULT keyword or specify a default.

E_W402D8_ONLY_FORWARD_DECLS


E_W402D9_METHOD_DECL_EXPECTED	"'Method' expected in declaration.\n"


E_W402EE_TOO_MANY_SOURCE_LINES


 Parameters:
	0	The maximum number of lines allowed in a 4gl component.

	1	The number of lines in the 4gl component being compiled.

 Explanation:
	The Windows/4GL compiler was asked to compile a 4gl component
	which contains too many lines in its source file.

 System Status:
	The compilation will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Reduce the number of lines in the 4gl component, for example
	by converting local procedures into global procedures.


E_W402F0_LENGTH_DECL_EXPECTED


E_W402F1_CASE_TYPECHK


 Explanation:
	Within the compilation of a case statement, one of the case values
	could not be converted to the type of the selector expression.

 System Status:
	Incorrect code will be generated for this case statement.

 Recommendation:
	Check the type of the selector expression and make sure all the
	values given are type compatible with it.


E_W402F2_DUPLICATE_DEFAULT


 Explanation:
      During the compiling of a 'case' statement, more than one 'default'
	case was specified.  Only one is allowed in each case statement.

 System Status:
	Only the first default statement will be honored.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the duplicate default cases from the case statement.


E_W402F3_DUPLICATE_CASE_VALUE


 Explanation:
      While compiling a 'case' statement, the compiler noticed that one
	or more constant values were the same.	This will cause a problem
	at runtime, since there is an ambiguity in which piece of code to
	execute.

 System Status:
	The program will probably not work properly when run.

 Recommendation:
	Check all the values in the case statement and eliminate any
	duplicate values found.


E_W402DD_PRIVATTR "'%0c' is a private attribute.\n


 Parameters:
	0		The name of the private attribute.

	1		The name of the field that this attribute was
			used in.

	2		The name of the class of the field.

 Explanation:
    Only public attributes of user classes are mapped to children
    of composite fields.

 System Status:
    The compilation will fail, because the field does not map to
    an attribute of its parent's user class properly.

 Recommendation:
    Change the field name, or redeclare the attribute to be public.


E_W402E4_TOO_MANY_LITERALS


 Parameters:
	0	The number of literals of the specified type
		in the 4GL component being compiled.

	1	The type of literals of which there are too many.
		(This type will be given by one of the slow messages below).

 Explanation:
	The Windows/4GL compiler has detected more than 32767 literals
	of a specific type.

 System Status:
	The compilation will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Try reducing the number of the specified type of literal
	in the component being compiled.  If that is not possible,
	split parts of it (each part including some of the specified type
	of literal) off into separate global procedures.


E_W402EA_TOO_MANY_VARS


 Parameters:
	0	The number of variables declared in the executable object
		being compiled.

	Microsoft Windows, release 3.x, was asked to compile an executable
	object which contains more than 32767 declared variables.
	[On Microsoft Windows, release 3.x, a lower limit is imposed,
	and E_W402EB_TOO_MANY_VARS_ON_WIN will appear if it's exceeded].

 System Status:
	The compilation will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Try reducing the number of variables in the executable object,
	or try splitting parts of it (each part including some variable
	declarations) off into separate local procedures.


E_W402EB_TOO_MANY_VARS_ON_WIN


 Parameters:
	0	The maximum number of variables allowed on Microsoft Windows.

	1	The number of variables declared in the executable object
		being compiled.

 Explanation:
	The Windows/4GL compiler, running under Microsoft Windows,
	release 3.x, was asked to compile an executable object 
	which contains too many declared variables.

 System Status:
	The compilation will fail.

 Recommendation:
	Try reducing the number of variables in the executable object,
	or try splitting parts of it (each part including some variable
	declarations) off into separate local procedures.


E_W402EC_TOO_MANY_VARS_FOR_WIN


 Parameters:
	0	The maximum number of variables allowed on Microsoft Windows.

	1	The number of variables declared in the executable object
		being compiled.

 Explanation:
	The Windows/4GL compiler, running on a platform other than
	Microsoft Windows, release 3.x, was asked to compile an executable
	object which contains too many declared variables for Windows.

 System Status:
	The compilation will continue.

 Recommendation:
	If you do not intend to run this application on Windows,
	no user action is necessary.  But if you *do* so intend,
	try reducing the number of variables in the executable object,
	or try splitting parts of it (each part including some variable
	declarations) off into separate local procedures.


E_W402ED_TOO_MANY_BLOCKS


 Parameters:
	0	The maximum number of blocks allowed in a 4gl component.

	1	The number of blocks defined in the 4gl component being
		compiled.

 Explanation:
	The Windows/4GL compiler was asked to compile a 4gl component
	which contains too many field scripts, event blocks, local procedures,
	and methods.

 System Status:
	The compilation will fail.

 Recommendation:

E_WR0000_NOSUCHDB	"Error connecting to database '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	The application could not successfully connect to the named database
	most likely because the database does not exist, or possibly because
	the commands specified using the ING_SET environment logical are
	incorrect.

	Occasionally, successful database connection may be precluded by
	other errors (e.g., GCA errors, etc.) usually evidence of some sort
	of installation problem or hardware or system failure.

 System Status:
	The application will not start up.

 Recommendation:
	Check that the database name was specified correctly and re-enter
	the command line.  Also, check that the commands specified using
	the ING_SET logical are correct.

	before reporting this problem to your technical support representative.


E_WR0003_PRMTYPE	"Value passed to parameter of incompatible type.\n


 Explanation:
	A value was passed to a parameter in a frame or procedure that did
	not agree in type with that declared for the parameter.  That is,
	the type of the value is not compatible with (coercible to) that
	of the parameter.

 System Status:
	The value of the parameter will be undefined.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure that the type of a value passed to a parameter agrees
	with the type declared for the parameter.


E_WR0004_POSTOOSL	"Positional parameters passed to 4GL procedure.\n


 Explanation:
	4GL procedures do not define any positional parameters.  All

 Recommendation:
	Pass parameters to 4GL procedures by name only.


E_WR0069_POSTODBPROC	"Positional parameters passed to database procedure.\n


 Explanation:
	Database procedures do not define any positional parameters.  All
	parameters passed to database procedures must be passed by name.

 System Status:
	The database procedure will not be called.

 Recommendation:
	Pass parameters to database procedures by name only.


 Explanation:
	Database procedures cannot be called with BYREF parameters.

 System Status:
	The BYREF will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Pass parameters to database procedures by value only.

 Explanation:
      A frame or procedure which does not have a valid database session
      has call a database procedure.  The frame's session may have been
      closed previously or may be NULL.  The database procedure can not be
      executed, since there is no database session in which to execute it.

 System Status:
      The database procedure will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
      Ensure that a valid database session is always current when a
      database procedure is called.


E_WR0005_KEYTOHOST	"Named parameters passed to host-language procedure.\n


 Explanation:
	Host language procedures do not define parameters passed by name.  All
	parameters passed to such procedures must be passed by position.

 System Status:
	The value passed to the procedure will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Pass parameters to host procedures by position only.


E_WR0006_RETNOTYPE


 Explanation:
	A frame or procedure was called and was expected to return a
	value.  However, the frame/procedure had been declared in ABF
	as not returning any value.

 System Status:
	No value will be returned from the called frame/procedure.

 Recommendation:
	Eliminate the reference to a return value in the calling frame,
	or change the declaration of the called frame/procedure.


E_WR0007_ABNULLPRM	"Possible Null value passed to non-Null parameter.\n


 Explanation:
	A value of a Nullable type is being passed to a parameter that has been
	declared as being not Nullable.  Passing a Null value to this parameter
	will result in a run-time error.  Since this value could be Nullable
	you can use the 'ifnull()' function to pass it, which will guarantee
	that a Null value is never passed to the non-Null parameter.

 System Status:
	If the value is not Null, it will be passed to the parameter; otherwise
	a run-time error will occur and the parameter will be undefined.

 Recommendation:
	Change the type of the parameter to be Nullable, or pass the
	value using the 'ifnull()' function, such as in 'ifnull(value)',
	instead.


E_WR0008_ABNULLBYREF	"Possible Null value returned by reference.\n


 Explanation:
	A parameter that is a Nullable type is being returned by reference to
	a field that is not Nullable.  At some point, if the parameter contains
	a Null value and is returned by reference, a run-time error will occur.

 System Status:
	If not Null, the parameter will be returned by reference; otherwise
	a run-time error will occur and the value of the field will be
	undefined.

 Recommendation:
	Change the type of the parameter to be not Nullable, or change
	the type of the field passed by reference to be Nullable.


E_WR0009_NOTBLFLD	"Table field report parameters are not yet supported.\n


 Explanation:
	A table field exists on a form used by a Report Frame.  At present
	no semantics have been defined for passing rows in the table field
	as parameters to the Report command.

 System Status:
	Table fields are ignored when passing parameters to the Report command.

 Recommendation:
	Do not create table fields on forms to be used by a Report Frame.


E_WR000A_DBGFILE	"Could not open FRS debug file.\n


 Explanation:
	DIAGNOSTIC.

 System Status:
	The application will terminate immediately.

 Recommendation:

	enough disk space to create and write files there before reporting this
	as a problem to your technical support representative.


E_WR000B_NOINIFRM	"Unable to initialize form for frame.\n


 Explanation:
	The Forms System returned an error when the ABF run-time system
	tried to initialize a form for a frame before calling the frame.
	Possibly, this is because the form does not exist, or its name was
	typed incorrectly on the User Frame definition form.

 System Status:
	The called frame will not be run.

 Recommendation:
	Create the form if it does not exist, or correct the name of the form
	defined for the frame before reporting this as a problem to your
	technical representative.

 Explanation:

 System Status:
	The application exits after issuing the error message.

 Recommendation:


E_WR000D_ABRETFRM	"Return value expected from non-4GL frame.\n


 Explanation:
	Frames such as QBF or Report frames that are not "User" frames (i.e.,
	that are not defined by 4GL source code) do not return values to frames
	that call them.

 System Status:
	The field designated to hold the return value has an undefined value.

 Recommendation:
	Delete the code assigning the return value from the frame.


E_WR000E_ABNULLOBJ	"Undefined routine for %1c '%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	The ABF run-time system found a NULL reference to a routine in its
	internal structures when the application tried to call or run an 4GL
	frame or procedure.  (This routine contains the executable code for
	the frame or procedure.)  ABF should generate a symbol for this routine,
	both in the internal run-time structures that it builds and in the code
	generated for the frame or procedure, when an application is built.
	Otherwise, this is an internal programming problem.

	In versions before release 6, this error could occur when the source
	files for a frame and a procedure shared a common file name but had
	different extensions (e.g., "xyz.osl" and "xyz.c".)  Then, the resultant
	object files would collide, most likely overwriting the code for the
	frame's routine.  ABF guarantees that this cannot occur in release 6
	applications by not allowing files to be specified for frames or
	procedures that share a common file name.

 System Status:
	The called frame will not be run.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative.


E_WR000F_RETTYPE	"Incompatible return type.\n


 Explanation:
	A return value from a frame or procedure did not agree in type with the
	expected type.  That is, the type of the return value is not compatible
	with (coercible to) the expected type declared for the frame or
	procedure.

 System Status:
	The return value will be undefined.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that the type of the value returned agrees with the
	expected type declared for the frame or procedure.


E_WR0010_ABEXPREVAL	"Error in evaluating an expression.\n


 Explanation:
	The ABF run-time system evaluates all expressions using the internal
	Abstract Data Facility defined for Ingres.  This facility returned an
	error for an expression is was to evaluate.  Since, 4GL generates the
	internal representation for these expressions from the source code,
	it is likely that it did so incorrectly.

 System Status:
	The result of the expression is undefined.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative.


E_WR0011_ABNULLNAME	"Null was used where a string is required.\n


 Explanation:

 System Status:
	The 4GL statement containing the NULL value will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
	Use a string constant or non-NULL field for the expected 4GL name.

E_WR001C_ABARGLIST		"Internal sub-system format error.\n


 Explanation:
      4GL compiles a parameter format list for each sub-system call that
      specifies the names and the types of the parameters being passed to
      the sub-system.  This format list is passed to the sub-system execution
      module when the CALL statement is executed, and it found an error in
      this list.  This is an internal programming problem.

 System Status:
	The called program could not be run successfully.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative.


E_WR001D_ABBADSPEC		"Sub-system parameter specification error.\n


 Explanation:
      The sub-system execution module uses an internal file that specifies
      the acceptable parameters and their command line formats for each
      sub-system, which is part of the installation for INGRES.  In this file,
      the format specification of the named parameter for this sub-system has
      been incorrectly specified.  This is an internal specification or
      installation problem.

 System Status:
	The called program could not be run successfully.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative.


E_WR001E_ABBADTYPE


 Explanation:
      4GL compiles a parameter format list for each sub-system call that
      specifies the names and the types of the parameters being passed to the
      sub-system.  This format list is passed to the sub-system execution
      module when the CALL statement is executed, and it found an illegal
      value specified for the type of the parameter in this format list.  This
      is an internal programming problem.

 System Status:
	The called program could not be run successfully.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative.


E_WR001F_ABNOSYM


 Explanation:
      A CALL statement in 4GL was made to an application sub-system whose
      name was specified as the "name" parameter to the call.  No symbol
      with that name specifying the application to be called can be found
      defined in the system.

 System Status:
	The called program could not be run successfully.

 Recommendation:
	Check for the correct name of the desired command.


E_WR0020_ABNOPROG


 Explanation:
      A CALL statement in 4GL specified the name of a sub-system that is not
      known to INGRES.  Most likely, this is because you incorrectly specified
      the sub-system in your 4GL source-code, but could also be because of an
      installation problem.

 System Status:
	The called program could not be run successfully.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the name of the program to be called.
	If necessary, refer to the ABF User's Guide for a list of
	legal program names.


E_WR0021_ABMODTYPE


 Explanation:
      The sub-system execution module uses an internal file that specifies
      the execution parameters for each sub-system, which is part of the
      installation for INGRES.  In this file, the module type for this
      sub-system has been incorrectly specified.  This is an internal or
      installation problem.

 System Status:
	The called program could not be run successfully.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative.


E_WR0022_ABNOARG


 Explanation:
      A CALL sub-system statement in 4GL specified a parameter that has not
      been defined for the sub-system.  Most likely, this is because you
      incorrectly specified the parameters for this sub-system in your 4GL
      source-code.  Rarely, this could also be because of an installation
      problem.

 System Status:
	The called program could not be run successfully.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the arguments to the program being called.
	If necessary, refer to the ABF User's Guide.


E_WR0025_ReqQueryMode	"Warning:  Form not in query mode.\n


 Parameters:
	%0c	the name of the currently running form.

 Explanation:
	When a form is run in query mode, both values and operators can be
	entered into fields.  These values and operators can then be used to
	build a query using the 4GL qualification predicate.  No qualification
	predicate can be constructed when the form is not in query mode.

 System Status:
	The query will be executed with a predicate of "1 = 1" in place of
	qualification predicate (meaning a predicate that is always true.)
	This will result in all rows being retrieved by the query.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the mode of the form is set to query (using the MODE query
	statement from 4GL) whenever a qualification predicate is used for
	a query.


E_WR004F_ABTRCFILE	"Could not open trace file.\n

	will be brought up without an application or abfimage will be terminated

 Recommendation:
	Check that name was spelled correctly.  Use a different name for a new
	application that follows correct conventions.


E_WR0052	"Cannot create temporary files.\n


 Explanation:
	The temporary directory cannot have files created within it.  This could
	be for several reasons, but most likely is because you do not have the
	required access rights to the temporary directory or because you do not
	have enough disk space available to create files in that directory.

	The temporary directory is either the current directory or the directory
	specified by the environment logical II_TEMPORARY.

 System Status:
	ABF or ABFIMAGE will terminate immediately.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that the you have access rights to the temporary directory and
	enough disk space to create and write files there before reporting this

	message.


E_WR006E_MaxSubSysPrms  "Maximum sub-system parameters exceeded.\n


 Explanation:
  A CALL sub-system statement in 4GL specified more parameters than are
  allowed for any sub-system.

 System Status:
  The sub-system will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
  Please refer to the INGRES Windows/4GL Reference Manual to determine the
  correct, legal parameters allowed for this sub-system call.  Then
  correct the parameters passed by the CALL statement in your 4GL source
  code file.


E_WR0033_PMFail	"Internal failure of PM.\n

E_AB0300_InvLanguage


 Explanation:
	The language specified with the II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE environment
	logical is not one supported by INGRES.

 System Action:
	Continue the build with the default (II_LANGUAGE) language instead.

 Recommendation:
	If the default language is not what was required, exit ABF, set
	II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE correctly, and rerun the build.


E_AB0301_NoConstants


 Explanation:
      The language specified with the II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE environment
      logical does not have values defined for the string constants.

 System Action:
      Continue the build with the default (II_LANGUAGE) language instead.

 Recommendation:
      If the default language is not what was required, define string
	constants for the II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE language and rerun the build.


E_AB0302_NoConstantValues


 Explanation:
	This constant has no value in any language.  This is an internal error.

 System Action:
	Exit.

  Recommendation:
	Rerun ABF and define values for the constant.


E_AB0303_NewLanguage


 Explanation:
      The default language does not have values defined for the string 
	constants.

 System Action:
      Continue the build with a language which does.

 Recommendation:
      If this language is not what was required, define string
      constants for the default language and rerun the build.

E_AB0012_NotLibOper	"You cannot %0c the source-code for a library


 Explanation:
	The Edit and Compile menuitems cannot be applied to the source-code for
	a library procedure.  Library procedures are maintained outside of the
	ABF environment through other means.  Library procedures do not have a
	source-code file specified, but are specified to ABF.  This allows
	these procedures to be called from the ABF RunTime environment.

 System Action:
	None.

 Recommendation:
	If the source-code for a procedure should be maintained by ABF, the
	procedure should be specified as not being a library procedure and the
	full name of the source-code file must be specified in the procedure
	definition.  The source-code file name consist of "name.ext" where
	the extension is a supported procedure type.

E_AB0048_Part_app	"A partial application with name %0c was found.


E_AB0049_NoDir	"No source-code directory has been specified.\n


 Explanation:
	ABF must have access to the source-code for an application's frames and
	procedures before it can perform certain operations (such as "Image".)
	This source-code directory must be specified in the labeled field of
	the Application Definition Form.  An empty specification DOES NOT
	mean the current directory.

 System Status:
	ABF will not execute any application dependent operations (such as
	"Go") until a valid source-code directory has been specified.

 Recommendation:
	Enter a valid source-code directory path in the labeled field of the
	Application Definition Form.


E_AB004A_BadDir	"The source code directory was not found.\n


 Explanation:
	ABF must have access to the source-code for an application's frames and
	procedures before it can perform certain operations (such as "Go".)
	The source-code directory path specified for the application
	could not be accessed by ABF.  This could be because it does not 
	exist, or because you do not have access rights to read it.

 System Status:
	ABF will not execute any application dependent operations (such as
	"Image") until a valid source-code directory has been specified.

 Recommendation:
	Enter a valid source-code directory path in the labeled field of the
	Application Definition Form.


E_AB004B_NoWrtDir	"The source-code directory is not writable.\n


 Explanation:
	You must have write access to the source-code directory for an ABF
	application before you create or edit any of the frames or procedures.
	The source-code directory specified in the labeled field of the ABF
	Application Defaults frame does not have any write permissions granted
	to you.

 System Status:
	ABF will not execute any application create or edit operations (such
	as "Create") until a writable source-code directory has been
	specified.

 Recommendation:
	Check that the source-code directory specified in the labeled field of
	the Application Definition Form is correct and that you have access
	rights to write to it.


E_AB004C_FileLength	"Source filename too long.\n


E_AB004D_BadDML	"Application with mixed SQL/QUEL frames and procedures.\n


E_AB0100	"Missing or inconsistent ABF symbol table.\n


 Explanation:
	To be able to run applications dynamically, ABF requires a special
	symbol table file to be present, "abf.stb", found in the "ingres!files"
	directory (which may be specified by the II_CONFIG environment logical.)
	This file should be readable, and it will be checked for consistency
	with the version of ABF that is being run.  If neither of these is true,
	then this is most likely because the installation is incorrect.

 System Status:
	FATAL.  ABF will exit.

 Recommendation:
	Please contact your site system manger and check that the INGRES
	installation is consistent.


E_AB0101	"The INGRES name, ING_ABFDIR, is not defined.\n


 Explanation:
	ABF (and ABFIMAGE) place object code files for an application image,
	on a per database and per application basis, in a directory that is
	a sub-tree of a base object code directory.  This base object code
	directory should be specified by the environment logical, ING_ABFDIR,
	and should be a directory where ABF can either find or create the object
	code directory sub-trees for applications.  Either component of the
	directory sub-tree for an application (that is, "database/application")
	will be created if it does not exist either when the application is
	created, or if the application already exists.

	ABF (and ABFIMAGE) require a base object code directory be specified
	before it can run.  This base object code directory should be specified
	through the environment logical, ING_ABFDIR, which should be set to the
	pathname of the base object code directory.  This is usually set on a
	system-wide basis.

 System Status:
	FATAL.  ABF will exit.

 Recommendation:
	Please contact your site system manager and inform them that the
	environment logical, ING_ABFDIR, has not been set.  (It should have
	been set on a system-wide basis.)  Also, contact your site system
	manager if it is necessary to find out the pathname of the directory
	to which you must set this environment logical and how to set it.


E_AB0102	"Non-existent ING_ABFDIR directory.\n


 Explanation:
	ABF (and ABFIMAGE) require that the base object code directory exist
	before it can run.  This base object code directory was specified
	through the environment logical, ING_ABFDIR, which was set to the
	pathname of this directory.  This path either does not exist or does
	not specify a directory.

	(For more information on what is a base object code directory, see
	the explanation for error E_AB0101.)

 System Status:
	FATAL.  ABF will exit.

 Recommendation:
	Please contact your site system manager and inform them that the
	pathname specified by the environment logical, ING_ABFDIR, is incorrect.
	Or, if you set this environment logical yourself, make sure that it
	correctly specifies the pathname for the base object code directory.


E_AB0103	"Unwritable ING_ABFDIR directory.\n


 Explanation:
	ABF (or ABFIMAGE) will need to create the entire object code directory
	sub-tree for any applications in the database since the database
	component of the sub-trees does not exist.  However, directories cannot
	be created in the base object code directory.  This is most likely
	because you do not have either access rights or enough disk space
	available to create directories in this directory.

	(For more information on object code directory sub-trees and the base
	object code directory, see the explanation for error E_AB0101.)

 System Status:
	FATAL.  ABF will exit.

 Recommendation:
	Please contact your site system manager and check that you have access
	rights and enough disk space to create directories in the base
	object code directory.


E_AB0104	"Non-existent application object code directory.\n


 Explanation:
	When an application already exists, then ABF (and ABFIMAGE) expect the
	directory sub-tree for the object code of the application to exist and
	will create it if it does not.  Then, since none of the object code
	files for the application exists, ABF will compile all the source files
	that belong to the application when it is run or imaged, which may take
	some time.  This would occur as it should when an application was copied
	from one system or database to another.

	However, if the object code directory for the application should exist,
	then it is likely that the environment logical, ING_ABFDIR, did not
	specify the correct pathname for the base object code directory that
	should contain the object code directory sub-tree for the application.
	This is a user error.

	(For more information on object code directory sub-trees and the base
	object code directory, see the explanation for error E_AB0101.)

 System Status:
	ABF will create the directory sub-tree and continue execution.

 Recommendation:
	No action required, unless the base object code directory path was not
	correctly specified through the environment logical ING_ABFDIR.  Then,
	exit ABF, set ING_ABFDIR correctly, and restart ABF.


E_AB0105	"Unwritable object code directory.\n


 Explanation:
	ABF (or ABFIMAGE) cannot create files in the object code directory for
	the application.  This is most likely because you do not have either
	access rights or enough disk space available to create files in this
	directory.  This directory must be writable so that ABF can compile the
	source files that belong to the application (4GL, EQL/C, compiled forms,
	etc.) into object code files placed there.

	(For more information on object code directory sub-trees and the base
	object code directory, see the explanation for error E_AB0101.)

 System Status:
	FATAL at present.  ABF will exit.

 Recommendation:
	Please contact your site system manager and make sure that you both have
	access rights to the object code directory and enough disk space is
	available to you to create files there.


E_AB0106	"Create object code directory error.\n


 Explanation:
	ABF (or ABFIMAGE) could not create an object code directory sub-tree
	component for the application in the database object code directory (or
	possibly could not create the database directory component in the base
	object code directory.)  This is most likely because you no longer have
	enough disk space available to you to create directories in the
	object code directory sub-tree.  Less likely, but still possible, is
	that you do not have access rights to create directories in the database
	object code directory.

 System Status:
	ABF (or ABFIMAGE) will stop whatever action was being performed,
	which most likely will stop the program.

 Recommendation:
	Please contact your site system manager and make sure that you have
	enough disk space available to create directories in the base object
	code directory.


E_AB0107_LibExists	"`%0c' exists.  The application cannot be created there."

E_AB0119	"There was an INGRES error while deleting the rows for the application `%0c'."


E_AB0120_CompErrs	"Compilation errors for `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	One of the programs used to compile a source file returned an error
	status, most likely because it detected a syntactic or semantic error
	in the source code, or because the source file does not exist.  Other
	possible causes might be because you do not have access rights or
	enough disk space to create files in either the temporary (working)
	directory or the object code directory for the application.

	Very rarely, these errors might be caused by an internal programming
	problem in the 4GL code generator, resulting in an error from that
	program or the C compiler.

 System Status:
	The compilation will be stopped and any "Image" or "Go" operation
	(ABF) or image build (ABFIMAGE) will not be completed.

 Recommendation:
	Edit the file and correct any syntactic or semantic errors.  Also, make
	sure that the you have access rights to both the temporary (working)
	directory and the object code directory for the application, and that
	enough disk space is available to you for both directories.  In
	the unlikely case that errors were detected by the 4GL code generator
	or the following C compilation, report this problem to your Site
	Technical Contact.


E_AB0121	"Internal ABF file creation error.\n


 Explanation:
	ABF (or ABFIMAGE) could not open the file used to define the run-time
	structures that define the application.  This could be for any number
	of reasons, but most likely is because you do not have access rights to
	the internal file (if it already exists) or because you have exceeded
	the disk space available to you in the object code directory for the
	application.

 System Status:
	The program will not stop, but the "Image" or "Go" operation (ABF)
	or image build (ABFIMAGE) will be stopped without completing.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that the you have access rights to both the internal file, if
	it exists, and to the object code directory for the application, and
	also that enough disk space is available to you in that directory.
	Then, retry the operation before reporting this as a problem to your
	Site Technical Contact.


E_AB0122	"Internal ABF file compilation error.\n


 Explanation:
	ABF (or ABFIMAGE) could not compile the internal file that defines the
	run-time structures that define an application.  This could be for
	any number of reasons, but most likely is because you did not have
	enough disk space in the object code directory for the application
	for ABF to either completely write the file or to compile the file into
	an object code file.

	If this error occurs and disk space or other file or process limitations
	are known not to be a problem, then this may be evidence of an internal
	program error in the creation of this file.

 System Status:
	The program will not stop, but the "Image" or "Go" operation (ABF)
	or image build (ABFIMAGE) will be stopped without completing.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that the you have enough disk space available in the
	object code directory for the application and retry the operation
	before reporting this as a problem to your Site Technical Contact.


E_AB0123	"Could not dynamically link the application `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	ABF could not link the application to be run dynamically.  This is most
	likely an operating system error, possibly because the link (or load)
	command could not find or read a required library or object file.  Or,
	another possible reason is that you have exceeded the disk space that is
	available to you in the temporary (or working) directory or you do not
	have access rights to that directory.

 System Status:
	ABF will not run the application.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that all the libraries and object files exist and are readable
	by you.  Also, make sure that the you both have access rights to the
	temporary directory and that enough disk space is available to you
	there.  Then, retry the operation before reporting this as a problem to
	your Site Technical Contact.


E_AB0124	"Application build compilation errors.\n


E_AB0125	"ABF ran out of memory while creating an internal table.  The error occurred in routine `%0c'."


E_AB0126	"Some tables needed by ABF could not be created and thus the application could not be run."


E_AB0127_NoRun	"ABF could not run the application because of errors."


E_AB0128_NoConstsGen	"Could not generate constants images.\n


 Explanation:
	ABF could not generate the pre-6.5 language-dependent constants image 
	files that are used by the application image when run in a  backward
	compatibility mode (i.e. logical II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE is defined).  
	This is because an error occurred when one of these language-dependent 
	constants files was created or written; these errors can occur only 
	when you do not have access-rights to the ABF database work directory 
	or language directories below it, or you have exceeded the disk space 
	available to you there.
	
 System Status:
	ABF will continue with the application build, but some of the language-
	dependent constants image files necessary to execute the application
	for different languages will not exist.

 Recommendation:
	The best action is to begin to use the new method for specifying 
	alternate sets of Global Constants, using user-maintained Global
	Constant Files, as described in the INGRES/ABF Reference Manual.
	If you need to continue to use the old method of ABF generated 
	language-dependent constants image files, then make sure that you 
	have access rights to the ABF work directory for the database and 
	to the language specific directories below it, and that you have
	sufficient disk space available there to create and write the
	constants image files.  Remember that this method will not be 
	supported in the next major release of INGRES/ABF or INGRES/VISION.


E_AB0129_InvAppLang 	"'%0c' is an invalid language.\n


 Explanation:
	The language specified with the II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE environment
	logical is not one supported by INGRES. This environment logical
	is only supported for backward compatibility with pre-6.5 releases
	of INGRES/ABF and INGRES/VISION.  Support will be discontinued in
	a future release.

 System Action:
	Continue the build, ignoring the II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE setting,
	and using the default constant values instead.

 Recommendation:
	If you must use the backward compatibility mode, exit back to the 
	operating system, reset II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE correctly, and rerun 
	the build.  Since support for this option will be discontinued
	in a future release, the best user action is to begin using the new
	method for specifying alternate sets of global constants using
	user-maintained Global Constant Files; please consult the INGRES/ABF
	Reference Manual for more information.


E_AB012A_AppLangUsed 	"Warning: II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE will not be supported in the next major release of INGRES/ABF or INGRES/VISION.\n


 Explanation:
	The II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE environment logical is set to a valid
	natural language, which indicates that global constants corresponding 
	to this language will be used during the build instead of the default 
	set of constant values.  This was the supported method for specifying 
	alternate sets of global constant values prior to release 6.5.  
	Currently, support for this environment logical exists for backward
	compatibility with pre-6.5 releases of INGRES/ABF and INGRES/VISION
	only, and will be discontinued in a future release.

 System Action:
	Continue the build, using the set of global constants corresponding to 
	the II_APPLICATION_LANGUAGE setting if they are defined.

 Recommendation:
	For now, no action is required.  In future releases of INGRES/ABF
	and INGRES/VISION, you will need to use the new method for specifying 
	alternate sets of global constants using user-maintained Global 
	Constant Files; please consult the INGRES/ABF Reference Manual for 
	more information.


E_AB012B_TypeChange 	"Cannot change the type of a Global Constant.\n


 Explanation:
	During an "Edit a Global Constant" operation, the type of the constant
	(char, varchar, integer, smallint, float, or decimal) may not be
	changed.  Only the length may be altered during the edit operation.

 System Action:
	Allow editing to resume, after restoring previous data type value.

 Recommendation:
	Continue editing the Global Constant definition.  If the data type
	must be changed, you must destroy the constant and re-create it.


E_AB012E_NoFormForm		"Missing or unreadable form `%0c'.\n


E_AB012F_NoForm		"Missing or unreadable form `%0c'.\n


E_AB0130_NoSrcFile	"Missing or unreadable source file `%1c'.\n

E_AB0136_UnsupportedExt	"Unsupported file extension.\n


E_AB0137_UnknownObject	"Unknown %0c name:  `%1c'\n


 Explanation:
	The name you specified for the new (different) application component
	that you want to edit is not the name of any of the components of this
	application.

 System Status:
	ABF will return to the previous application component edit frame.

 Recommendation:
	Specify the correct name when prompted after again selecting the
	NewEdit menuitem and the component type menuitem.  If you are
	unsure of the correct name, return to the Edit Application frame
	and examine the names displayed in the table field.


E_AB0138_IllegalFileName	"Illegal file name: `%0c'\n


 Explanation:
	The given name was not recognized as a legal file name on this system
	for the application source-code directory although it may be a legal
	path name.  ABF expects only a file name (or a relative path name) in
	this context, not a full path name.  File names generally consist of a
	name and an extension, while path names specify the full directory path
	for the file.

 System Status:
	ABF will not continue until a legal file name is specified.

 Recommendation:
	Specify a legal file name.


E_AB0139_UnsupportedLang	"Unsupported host-language.\n


 Explanation:
	The host-language specified for a procedure is not supported on the
	system where the application is being executed or compiled.  This
	application was defined on a system that did support the host-language,
	but was then accessed (through INGRES/Net) or copied (using COPYAPP) on
	a system that does not support it.  This is not supported.

 Recommendation:
	Destroy the procedure and recreate it for a host-language supported on
	both systems.  Then, rewrite the source-code for the procedure in this
	common host-language.

E_AB0264_BadConstValue	"Illegal constant value for type: `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	The value specified for the constant is not legal for the type of the
	constant.  For example, "xyz" is not a legal integer, float, or decimal
	number.  The value must be legal for the type.


E_AB0265_BadConstType	"Illegal value for constant data type: `%0c'.\n


 Recommendation:
	Please refer to the INGRES ABF Reference Manual for legal application
	constant types.  Or, select ListChoices from the menu to get a list of
	legal INGRES types.


 Explanation:
	The length of a character constant is determined by its value since
	that can change for different languages.  For example, "Hello" in
	English and "Bonjour" in French.  You should not specify a length
	in the type specification for a constant.

 System Status:
	ABF will ignore the length in the type specification and replace it
	with a non-length specific type specification.

 Recommendation:
	None.


E_AB0263_RecRecursion	"Illegal record attribute type.\n


 Explanation:
      Recursive definitions of record types are not allowed.  That is, a
      record attribute cannot contain the record being defined.  Legal record
	attribute types are any legal INGRES type or any other record type
	defined for this application.

 System Status:
      ABF will resume to the type field where you must enter a legal type
      for the record attribute.

 Recommendation:
      Please refer to the INGRES Reference Manual for legal INGRES types.  Or,**      select ListChoices from the menu to get a list of legal INGRES types.


E_AB0267_RecAttr	"Illegal record attribute type.\n


 Explanation:
	Recursive definitions of record types are not allowed.  That is, a
	record attribute cannot be of the same type as the record being defined.
	Legal record attribute types are any legal INGRES type or any record
	type defined for this application that does not contain the current
	record either directly or indirectly.

 System Status:
	ABF will resume to the type field where you must enter a legal type
	for the record attribute.

E_AB0269_Data_type	"Illegal value for data type: `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	Record attributes can only be types that are legal INGRES types or
	are record types already defined for the application (other than the
	record type being defined).  The type entered for a record attribute
	was not recognized as specifying one of these legal types.

 System Status:
	ABF will resume to the type field where you must enter a legal type
	for the record attribute.

 Recommendation:
	Please refer to the INGRES Reference Manual for legal INGRES types.  Or,
	select ListChoices from the menu to get a list of legal INGRES types.


E_AB026C_Not_int_type	"Illegal value for data type: `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	Database procedures can only return a single-valued integer as a result,
	or none.  The data type specified as the return type for the database
	procedure is not an integer.

 System Status:
	ABF will resume to the type field where you must enter a legal type
	for the return type of the database procedure, or "none" if the it
	does not return a value.

 Recommendation:
	Please refer to the INGRES Reference Manual for legal INGRES types.
	Or, select ListChoices from the menu to get a list of legal database
	procedure return types.

E_AB0281_PathName 	"Source file name cannot be a pathname.\n


E_AB026D_rtt	"Could not build internal data file `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	ABF could not build a temporary file used to pass runtime information
	to the interpreter.  This is most likely because you have exceeded
	the disk space that is available to you in the temporary (or working)
	directory or you do not have access rights to that directory.

	Very unlikely, but possible, this error will indicate that ABF could
	not build the file because of an internal error.

 System Status:
	ABF will not proceed with "Go" (test) operation.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that the you both have access rights to the temporary
	directory and that enough disk space is available to you there.
	Then, retry the operation before reporting this as a problem to
	your Site Technical Contact.

E_AB026F_Rename	"Could not remove old object code directory.\n


 Explanation:
	When handling a rename operation, we were able to create a new
	object code directory, but not able to remove the old one.

 System Status:
	Rename operation is treated as successful, but future new applications
	with the old name will experience difficulties because the object
	code directory will already exist.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the directory

E_AR0000_NOSUCHDB       "Error connecting to database `%0c'."


 Explanation:
      The application could not successfully connect to the named database
      most likely because the database does not exist, or possibly because
      the commands specified using the ING_SET environment logical are
      incorrect.

      Occasionally, successful database connection may be precluded by
      other errors (e.g., GCA errors, etc.) usually evidence of some sort
      of installation problem or hardware or system failure.

 System Status:
      The application will not start up.

 Recommendation:

      The application exits after issuing the error message.

 Recommendation:
      Report this problem to your site technical contact.


E_AR0002_ALLOCFRM       "Cannot initialize ABF form.\n


 Explanation:
      The ABF run-time system could not start the INGRES Forms System or
      initialize its required forms.  This could be for several reasons
      including ...

 System Status:
      The application terminates immediately.

 Recommendation:
      Check that the system terminal type environment logical has been 
	set correctly before reporting this problem to your site 
	technical contact.


E_AR0003_PRMTYPE        "Value passed to parameter of incompatible type.\n


 Explanation:
      A value was passed to a parameter in a frame or procedure that did
      not agree in type with that declared for the parameter.  That is,
      the type of the value is not compatible with (coercible to) that
      of the parameter.

 System Status:
      The value of the parameter will be undefined.

 Recommendation:
      Ensure that the type of a value passed to a parameter agrees
      with the type declared for the parameter.


E_AR0004_POSTOOSL       "Positional parameters passed to 4GL procedure.\n


 Explanation:
      4GL procedures do not define any positional parameters.  All
      parameters passed to 4GL procedures must be passed by name.

 System Status:
      The value passed to the procedure will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
      Pass parameters to 4GL procedures by name only.


E_AR0005_KEYTOHOST      "Named parameters passed to host-language procedure.\n


 Explanation:
      Host language procedures do not define parameters passed by name.  All
      parameters passed to such procedures must be passed by position.

 System Status:
      The value passed to the procedure will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
      Pass parameters to host procedures by position only.


E_AR0006_RETNOTYPE


 Explanation:
      A frame or procedure was called and was expected to return a
      value.  However, the frame/procedure had been declared in ABF
      as not returning any value.

 System Status:
      No value will be returned from the called frame/procedure.

 Recommendation:
      Eliminate the reference to a return value in the calling frame,
      or change the declaration of the called frame/procedure.


E_AR0007_ABNULLPRM      "Possible Null value passed to non-Null parameter.\n


 Explanation:
      A value of a Nullable type is being passed to a parameter that has been
      declared as being not Nullable.  Passing a Null value to this parameter
      will result in a run-time error.  Since this value could be Nullable
      you can use the 'ifnull()' function to pass it, which will guarantee
      that a Null value is never passed to the non-Null parameter.

 System Status:
      If the value is not Null, it will be passed to the parameter; otherwise
      a run-time error will occur and the parameter will be undefined.

 Recommendation:
      Change the type of the parameter to be Nullable, or pass the
      value using the 'ifnull()' function, such as in 'ifnull(value)',
      instead.


E_AR0008_ABNULLBYREF    "Possible Null value returned by reference.\n


 Explanation:
      A parameter that is a Nullable type is being returned by reference to
      a field that is not Nullable.  At some point, if the parameter contains
      a Null value and is returned by reference, a run-time error will occur.

 System Status:
      If not Null, the parameter will be returned by reference; otherwise
      a run-time error will occur and the value of the field will be
      undefined.

 Recommendation:
      Change the type of the parameter to be not Nullable, or change
      the type of the field passed by reference to be Nullable.


E_AR0009_NOTBLFLD       "Table field report parameters are not yet supported.\n


 Explanation:
      A table field exists on a form used by a Report Frame.  At present
      no semantics have been defined for passing rows in the table field
      as parameters to the Report command.

 System Status:
      Table fields are ignored when passing parameters to the Report command.

 Recommendation:
      Do not create table fields on forms to be used by a Report Frame.


E_AR000A_DBGFILE        "Could not open FRS debug file.\n


 Explanation:
      DIAGNOSTIC.

 System Status:
      The application will terminate immediately.

 Recommendation:
      Make sure that the you have access rights to the current directory and
      enough disk space to create and write files there before reporting this
      as a problem to your site technical contact.


E_AR000B_NOINIFRM       "Unable to initialize form for frame.\n


 Explanation:
      The Forms System returned an error when the ABF run-time system
      tried to initialize a form for a frame before calling the frame.
      Possibly, this is because the form does not exist, or its name was
      typed incorrectly on the User Frame definition form.

 System Status:
      The called frame will not be run.

 Recommendation:
      Create the form if it does not exist, or correct the name of the form
      defined for the frame before reporting this as a problem to your
      site technical contact.


E_AR000C_ABNXTYPE       "Unknown frame type called.\n


 Explanation:

 System Status:
      The application exits after issuing the error message.

 Recommendation:


E_AR000D_ABRETFRM       "Return value expected from non-4GL frame.\n


 Explanation:
      Frames such as QBF or Report frames that are not "User" frames (i.e.,
      that are not defined by 4GL source code) do not return values to frames
      that call them.

 System Status:
      The field designated to hold the return value has an undefined value.

 Recommendation:
      Delete the code assigning the return value from the frame.


E_AR000E_ABNULLOBJ      "Undefined routine for %1c `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
      The ABF run-time system found a NULL reference to a routine in its
      internal structures when the application tried to call or run an
      INGRES/4GL frame or procedure.  (This routine contains the executable
      code for the frame or procedure.)  ABF should generate a symbol for
      this routine, both in the internal run-time structures that it builds
      and in the code generated for the frame or procedure, when an
      application is built.  Otherwise, this is an internal programming
      problem.

      In versions before release 6, this error could occur when the source
      files for a frame and a procedure shared a common file name but had
      different extensions (e.g., "xyz.osl" and "xyz.c".)  Then, the resultant
      object files would collide, most likely overwriting the code for the
      frame's routine.  ABF guarantees that this cannot occur in release 6
      applications by not allowing files to be specified for frames or
      procedures that share a common file name.

 System Status:
      The called frame will not be run.

 Recommendation:
      Report this problem to your site technical contact.


E_AR000F_RETTYPE        "Incompatible return type.\n


 Explanation:
      A return value from a frame or procedure did not agree in type with the
      expected type.  That is, the type of the return value is not compatible
      with (coercible to) the expected type declared for the frame or
      procedure.

 System Status:
      The return value will be undefined.

 Recommendation:
      Make sure that the type of the value returned agrees with the
      expected type declared for the frame or procedure.


E_AR0010_ABEXPREVAL     "Error in evaluating an expression.\n


 Explanation:
      The ABF run-time system evaluates all expressions using the internal
      Abstract Data Facility defined for INGRES.  This facility returned an
      error for an expression is was to evaluate.  Since, 4GL generates the
      internal representation for these expressions from the source code,
      it is likely that it did so incorrectly.

 System Status:
      The result of the expression is undefined.

 Recommendation:
      Report this problem to your site technical contact.


E_AR0011_ABNULLNAME     "Null was used where a string is required.\n


 Explanation:

 System Status:
      The 4GL statement containing the NULL value will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
      Use a string constant or non-NULL field for the expected 4GL name.


E_AR0012_ABNOFIELD      "Bad field specified in query passed between frames.\n


 Explanation:

 System Status:
      The named field will be ignored in the processing of the query.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the query being passed into the called frame so
      that it lists the proper fields.


E_AR0013_ABNOTFCOL      "Unknown table field column in parameter query.\n


 Explanation:

 System Status:
      The named table field column will be ignored in the
      processing of the query.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the query being passed into the called frame so
      that it lists the proper table field columns.


E_AR0014_NOQRYFRM       "Wrong form referenced in query passed between frames.\n


 Explanation:

 System Status:
      The form for the called frame will be used rather than the
      form named in the passed-in query.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the name of the called frame's form in the query being
      passed between frames.


E_AR0015_NOQRYTBL       "Wrong table field referenced in passed-in query.\n


 Explanation:

 System Status:
      The query will not be executed.

 Explanation:
      A parameter with an incorrect name was passed to an INGRES/4GL
      frame or procedure.

 System Status:
      The parameter will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the name of the parameter in the calling frame or
      procedure.


E_AR001A_ABPROGERR      "Execution failure in program `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
      The program could not be executed, possibly because it could not
      be found, or it was executed but returned a failure status because
      of an internal programming error.

 System Status:
      The program could not be called, or was called but returned
      with a failure status.

 Recommendation:
      Check your installation before reporting this problem to your
      site technical contact.


E_AR001B_CmdTooBig      "Sub-system command too large.\n

      Reduce the size of the command by reducing the number and/or
      size of the parameters.


E_AR001C_4GLPrmList     "Internal sub-system format error.\n


 Explanation:
      4GL compiles a parameter format list for each sub-system call that
      specifies the names and the types of the parameters being passed to
      the sub-system.  This format list is passed to the sub-system execution
      module when the CALL statement is executed, and it found an error in
      this list.  This is an internal programming problem.

 System Status:
      The sub-system will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
      Make note of the information reported in the error message and then
      report this internal problem to your site technical contact.


E_AR001D_UTBadSpec      "Sub-system parameter specification error.\n


 Explanation:
      The sub-system execution module uses an internal file that specifies
      the acceptable parameters and their command line formats for each
      sub-system, which is part of the installation for INGRES.  In this file,
      the format specification of the named parameter for this sub-system has
      been incorrectly specified.  This is an internal specification or
      installation problem.

 System Status:
      The sub-system will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
      Make note of the information reported in the error message and then
      report this problem to your site technical contact.


E_AR001E_4GLPrmType     "Internal sub-system format type error.\n


 Explanation:
      4GL compiles a parameter format list for each sub-system call that
      specifies the names and the types of the parameters being passed to the
      sub-system.  This format list is passed to the sub-system execution
      module when the CALL statement is executed, and it found an illegal
      value specified for the type of the parameter in this format list.  This
      is an internal programming problem.

 System Status:
      The sub-system will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
      Make note of the information reported in the error message and then
      report this internal problem to your site technical contact.


E_AR001F_NoAppSymbol    "Undefined application symbol.\n


 Explanation:
      A CALL statement in 4GL was made to an application sub-system whose
      name was specified as the "name" parameter to the call.  No symbol
      with that name specifying the application to be called can be found
      defined in the system.

 System Status:
      The application could not be executed.

 Recommendation:
      Check that the application symbol name has been defined on your system
      and then correct the name of the application in the CALL statement.  Or,
      you can specify the full pathname for the executable image of the
      application that you wish to call as the "executable" parameter to the
      call instead of using the "name" parameter.


E_AR0020_NoSubSystem    "Unknown INGRES sub-system, `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
      A CALL statement in 4GL specified the name of a sub-system that is not
      known to INGRES.  Most likely, this is because you incorrectly specified
      the sub-system in your 4GL source-code, but could also be because of an
      installation problem.

 System Status:
      The sub-system could not be executed.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the name of the sub-system to be called.  If necessary, refer
      to the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual for a list of legal sub-system
      names.  Otherwise, if you know that the sub-system is a legal one,
      report this installation problem to your site technical contact.


E_AR0021_UTBadModule    "Internal sub-system module error.\n


 Explanation:
      The sub-system execution module uses an internal file that specifies
      the execution parameters for each sub-system, which is part of the
      installation for INGRES.  In this file, the module type for this
      sub-system has been incorrectly specified.  This is an internal or
      installation problem.

 System Status:
      The sub-system will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
      Make note of the information reported in the error message and then
      report this problem to your site technical contact.


E_AR0022_BadParam       "Unknown sub-system parameter.\n


 Explanation:
      A CALL sub-system statement in 4GL specified a parameter that has not
      been defined for the sub-system.  Most likely, this is because you
      incorrectly specified the parameters for this sub-system in your 4GL
      source-code.  Rarely, this could also be because of an installation
      problem.

 System Status:
      The sub-system cannot be executed.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the parameters to the sub-system being called.  If necessary,
      refer to the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual for a list of the legal
      parameters for this sub-system.  Otherwise, if you know that the
      parameter is a legal one for the sub-system, report this installation
      problem to your site technical contact.


E_AR0027_MaxSubSysPrms  "Maximum sub-system parameters exceeded.\n


 Explanation:
      A CALL sub-system statement in 4GL specified more parameters than are
      allowed for any sub-system.

 System Status:
      The sub-system will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
      Please refer to the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual to determine the
      correct, legal parameters allowed for this sub-system call.  Then
      correct the parameters passed by the CALL statement in your 4GL source
      code file.


E_AR0025_ReqQueryMode   "Warning:  Form not in query mode.\n


 Parameters:
      %0c     the name of the currently running form.

 Explanation:
      When a form is run in query mode, both values and operators can be
      entered into fields.  These values and operators can then be used to
      build a query using the 4GL qualification predicate.  No qualification
      predicate can be constructed when the form is not in query mode.

 System Status:
      The query will be executed with a predicate of "1 = 1" in place of
      qualification predicate (meaning a predicate that is always true.)
      This will result in all rows being retrieved by the query.

 Recommendation:
      Make sure the mode of the form is set to query (using the SET_FORMS
      statement from 4GL) whenever a qualification predicate is used for
      a query.


E_AR0026_RoleOverride   "Application role ID cannot be overridden.\n


 Explanation:
      A role ID was specified on the command-line, but cannot override the
      role ID with which the application was built.

 System Status:
      The application will terminate as this is a security violation.

 Recommendation:
      Do not attempt to override the application role ID by specifying one
      one the command line to the application.


E_AR0028_POSTOSQL       "Positional parameters passed to SQL procedure.\n


 Explanation:
      SQL procedures do not define any positional parameters.  All
      parameters passed to SQL procedures must be passed by name.

 System Status:
      The value passed to the procedure will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
      Pass parameters to SQL procedures by name only.


E_AR004F_ABTRCFILE      "Could not open trace file.\n


 Explanation:
      DIAGNOSTIC.

 System Status:
      ABF or ABFIMAGE will terminate immediately.

E_AR0052        "Cannot create temporary files.\n


 Explanation:
      The temporary directory cannot have files created within it.  This could
      be for several reasons, but most likely is because you do not have the
      required access rights to the temporary directory or because you do not
      have enough disk space available to create files in that directory.

      The temporary directory is either the current directory or the directory
      specified by the environment logical II_TEMPORARY.

 System Status:
      ABF or ABFIMAGE will terminate immediately.

 Recommendation:
      Make sure that the you have access rights to the temporary directory and
      enough disk space to create and write files there before reporting this
      as a problem to your site technical contact.


E_AR0053_glo_undef "Global variable/constant `%0c' undefined.\n


 Explanation:
      The application could not access a global variable or application
      constant.  The variable/constant was probably deleted after the last
      time the current 4GL frame or procedure was compiled.

 System Status:
      The application is unable to initialize the frame or procedure, and
      flow-of-control will return to the calling 4GL code.

 Recommendation:
      Please recompile the 4GL code for the frame or procedure that is trying
      to access the undefined global variable or application constant.
      If this fails, report this as a problem to your site technical contact.


E_AR0054_glo_mismatch "Global variable/constant `%0c' has wrong datatype.\n


 Explanation:
      The application found a global variable or application constant, but it
      was not the expected type.  The variable/constant was probably edited
      after the last time the current 4GL frame or procedure was compiled.

 System Status:
      The application is unable to initialize the frame or procedure, and
      flow-of-control will return to the calling 4GL code.

 Recommendation:
      Please recompile the 4GL code for the frame or procedure that is trying
      to access the mismatched global variable or application constant.
      If this fails, report this as a problem to your site technical contact.


E_AR0055_bad_type "Type `%0c' not found.\n


 Explanation:
      The application found a variable declared to be a complex data type,
      but the complex data type does not exist.  The data type was probably
      deleted or changed after the last time the current 4GL frame or
      procedure was compiled.

 System Status:
      The application is unable to continue executing the frame or procedure.
      Flow-of-control will return to the calling 4GL code.

 Recommendation:
      Please recompile the 4GL code for any frames or procedures that use
      this type definition.  If this fails, report this as a problem to
      your site technical contact.


E_AR0056_no_attribute "Field `%0c' not found in '%1c'.\n


 Explanation:
      The application found a reference to a field in a variable declared
      to be a complex data type, but the complex data type does not have a
      field with this name.  The complex data type was probably
      changed after the last time the current 4GL frame or
      procedure was compiled.

 System Status:
      The application is unable to continue executing the frame or procedure.
      Flow-of-control will return to the calling 4GL code.

 Recommendation:
      Please recompile the 4GL code for any frames or procedures that use
      this type definition.  If this fails, report this as a problem to
      your site technical contact.


E_AR0057_bad_index "Row number `%0c' out of range in array."


 Explanation:
      The application found a reference to a row of an array, but the array
      doesn't contain a row with that number.

 System Status:
      The array reference will default to the highest-numbered row of the
      array.  If the array is empty, the result of the array reference is
      undefined.

 Recommendation:
      This is a bug in the user's 4GL code.


E_AR0058_typeerr "Could not assign `%0c' to `%1c'.\n


 Explanation:
      The application tried to assign a value to another, but the
      types of the values were not compatible.

 System Status:
      The value of the parameter will be undefined.

      Ensure that the type of the values match or are coercible.


E_AR0059_notarray "Tried row operation on value of type `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_AR0060_class_fail "Internal failure in accessing class `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_AR0061_nullint


 Explanation:
      Some statements that take integer expressions do not allow
      NULL values.  For example, a table field reference can not
      have a NULL value for the row number.  However, this error
      is not detectable until run-time, since the expression may
      evaluate to a non-NULL value.  The 4GL code needs to be
      changed so that the expression guarantees a non-NULL value.

 System Status:
      The statement continues with a default value.

 Recommendation:
      Change the 4GL code so that a non-NULL value is produced.


E_AR0062_not_scalar "Type `%0c' (of attribute `%1c') not


 Explanation:
      Some statements that take class attributes cannot operate on
      complex types.

 System Status:
      The statement continues, but has no effect on this value.

 Recommendation:
      Change the 4GL code so that only scalar data is referenced.


E_AR0063_bad_convert_into "A datatype conversion error occurred while


 Explanation:
      An operation tried to insert a value into an object or an array row.
      The datatype of the object attribute did not match that of the
      inserted value.

 System Status:
      The statement continues, but has no effect on the object attribute.

 Recommendation:
      Change the 4GL code so that an appropriate value is inserted.


E_AR0064_bad_convert_from "A datatype conversion error occurred while


 Explanation:
      An operation tried to get a value from an object or an array row.
      The datatype of the object attribute did not match that of the
      target variable.

 System Status:
      The statement continues, but has no effect on the target variable.

 Recommendation:
      Change the 4GL code so that an appropriate value is inserted.


E_AR0065_BadHostArgType


 Explanation:
      An argument of a complex datatype (e.g. record or array)
      was erroneously passed to a 3GL procedure.

 System Status:
      ABF will not call the 3GL procedure.

 Recommendation:
      Modify the calling frame or procedure to pass different arguments
      or to call a different (4GL) procedure.


E_AR0066_NoDBSession


 Explanation:
      The application must be switched to use an active database session
      before any subsystems can be called. This also applies to "call
      application" calls.  Use either the set_sql(session = ) statement
      to switch to an existing connection, or use the 4GL CONNECT statement
      to create a new connection.

 System Status:
      The subsystem will not be called.

 Recommendation:
      Make sure that the application is switched to an active session
      before attempting to call a subsystem.


E_AR0067_BadSessionID


 Explanation:
      An invalid session identifier was specified as part of a CONNECT
      or DISCONNECT statement - this value must be a positive integer.

 System Status:
      The operation will not be performed.

 Recommendation:
      Make sure that a valid session identifier is specified if you choose
      to use the SESSION clause in the 4GL CONNECT and DISCONNECT statements.


E_AR0068_BadConnName


 Explanation:
      An invalid connection name was specified as part of a CONNECT
      or DISCONNECT statement - this value must not begin with the characters
      "ii-".  This prefix is reserved for non-user sessions.

 System Status:
      The operation will not be performed.

 Recommendation:
      Make sure that a valid connection name is specified as part of
      the 4GL CONNECT and DISCONNECT statements.


E_AR0069_ConnectError


 Explanation:
      A previous error has caused the CONNECT operation to fail.

 System Status:
      The connect operation will not be performed and the application will
      be no longer be switched to an existing database session.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the cause of the CONNECT failure.


E_AR006A_NOINIFRM_NODB  "Unable to initialize form for frame.\n


 Explanation:
      The ABF run-time system tried to initialize a form for a
      frame while the application was not switched to an active database
      session.  This may not be performed when running the image for frames
      that have uncompiled forms.

 System Status:
      The called frame will not be run.

 Recommendation:
      The application must be switched to an active database session before
      frames are called which have uncompiled forms, when the application
      image is run.


E_AR006B_DiscSystemSession


 Explanation:
      A DISCONNECT [CURRENT] statement was issued while the application was
      switched to a non-user session (i.e. a session identified by a negative
      session identifier).  This is not permissible.

 System Status:
      The disconnect operation will not be performed.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the cause of the invalid DISCONNECT statement.


E_AR006C_DiscNoSession


 Explanation:
      A DISCONNECT [CURRENT] statement was issued while the application was
      not switched to a user session. This is not permissible.

 System Status:
      The disconnect operation will not be performed.

 Recommendation:
      Correct the cause of the invalid DISCONNECT statement.


E_AR002A_NoQry  "Missing look-up query parameter.\n


 Explanation:
      The look-up function requires a query to be specified using the
      'ii_query' keyword parameter.  Otherwise, it cannot execute.

 System Status:
      The look-up frame will not execute and no values will be returned.

 Recommendation:
      Consult the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual and then specify the
      required query in the call to the look-up frame.

 Note: This message has been superseded by E_AR003A (as of 6.4).


E_AR002B_UnknownColumn  "Unknown look-up column `%1c'.\n


 Explanation:
      If the parameter 'ii_query' is specified, then any parameter
      of the form 'ii_field'n must specify a column of the query
      specified by the 'ii_query' parameter.

 System Status:
      The look_up frame will not execute and no values will be returned.

 Recommendation:
      Consult the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual and then correct the
      parameters passed to the look-up frame in this instance.


E_AR002C_MissingColumn  "Missing look-up display column parameter.\n


 Explanation:
      The parameters to the look-up frame did not specify all the columns to
      be displayed.  This frame expects all columns that are to be displayed
      to be specified by name through the ordinal position parameters,
      'ii_fieldn', where n is the number of the displayed column.  They must
      be contiguous between one and the number of columns to be displayed by
      the look-up frame.  (It doesn't make sense otherwise.)

      Either one or more columns were not specified (e.g., 'ii_field1',
      'ii_field2', and 'ii_field4' were specified but 'ii_field3' was not),
      or a title was specified through an 'ii_field_titlen' parameter but
      the number of displayed columns was less than n (e.g., 'ii_field1' and
      'ii_field2' and 'ii_field_title3' were specified.)

 System Status:
      The look-up frame will not execute and no values will be returned.

 Recommendation:
      Consult the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual and then correct the
      parameters passed to the look-up frame in this instance.


E_AR002D_NoColumns      "Missing look-up display column parameters.\n


E_AR002E_NotByReference "Missing BYREF expression for parameter.\n


 Explanation:
      The look-up frame allows a user to select values from a list and then
      returns them by reference to its calling parameters.  You have specified
      one of these parameters but did not specify its value using the by
      reference function, BYREF().  Because of this, the look-up frame will
      be unable to return a value to that parameter.

 System Status:
      The look-up frame will not execute and no values will be returned.

 Recommendation:
      Specify the parameter by reference by adding the BYREF function
      to the calling value.  For example, "column = BYREF(parameter)"
      instead of "column = parameter".


E_AR002F_NoValuesReturned       "Missing column parameters.\n


 Explanation:
      The look-up frame allows a user to select values from a list
      and then returns them by reference to some of its calling parameters.
      If none of these parameters were specified, but a query was specified
      (rather than an array), then the look-up frame cannot return any values.
      Since by calling the look-up frame you must have intended some values
      to be returned, it is an error not to have specified any return values
      by reference.

 System Status:
      The look-up frame will not execute and no values will be returned.

 Recommendation:
      Consult the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual and then specify the
      desired return values as by reference parameters.


E_AR0038_NoLookupinQUEL


 Explanation:
      The look_up function is not supported in QUEL. A look_up call
      was detected in a QUEL frame.

 System Status:
      The look_up frame will not execute and no values will be returned.

 Recommendation:
      Remove the call to look_up from this QUEL frame or procedure.


E_AR0039_BothQueryAndArray


 Explanation:
      The look_up function requires a query or array to be specified
      using the 'ii_query' or 'ii_array' keyword parameter, but not both.
      Otherwise, it cannot execute.

 System Status:
      The look_up frame will not execute and no values will be returned.

 Recommendation:
      Consult the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual and then specify the
      required query or array in the call to the look-up frame.


E_AR003A_NoQueryOrArray "No query or array parameter specified for look_up.\n


 Explanation:
      The look_up function requires a query or array to be specified
      using the 'ii_query' or 'ii_array' keyword parameter.
      Otherwise, it cannot execute.

 System Status:
      The look_up frame will not execute and no values will be returned.

 Recommendation:
      Consult the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual and then specify the
      required query or array in the call to the look-up frame.


E_AR003B_UnknownAttr    "Unknown look_up attribute `%1c'.\n


 Explanation:
      If the parameter 'ii_array' is specified, then any parameter
      of the form 'ii_field'n must specify a simple attribute of the array
      specified by the 'ii_array' parameter.

 System Status:
      The look_up frame will not execute and no values will be returned.

 Recommendation:
      Consult the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual and then correct the
      parameters passed to the look-up frame in this instance.


E_AR003C_BothQualifyAndArray


 Explanation:
      The optional parameter 'ii_qualify' may be specified for the look_up
      function only if a query is specified using the 'ii_query' parameter.

 System Status:
      The look_up frame will not execute and no values will be returned.

 Recommendation:
      Consult the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual and then correct the
      parameters passed to the look-up frame in this instance.


E_AR003D_NotArray       "Array parameter does not specify an array.\n


 Explanation:
      The parameter 'ii_array' must specify an array.

 System Status:
      The look_up frame will not execute and no values will be returned.

 Recommendation:
      Consult the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual and then correct the
      parameters passed to the look-up frame in this instance.


E_AR003E_BadColNum      "Invalid display column number `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
      If a parameter name begins with 'ii_field' or 'ii_field_title',
      then the full name must be of the form 'ii_field'n or 'ii_field_title'n,
      where n is a positive number no greater than
      the number of columns or attributes in the query or array.

 System Status:
      The look_up frame will not execute and no values will be returned.

 Recommendation:
      Consult the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual and then correct the
      parameters passed to the look-up frame in this instance.


E_AR003F_DuplicateCols  "Duplicate display column parameters.\n


 Explanation:
      Two different parameters of the form 'ii_field'n may not specify
      the same column or attribute of the query or array.

 System Status:
      The look_up frame will not execute and no values will be returned.

 Recommendation:
      Consult the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual and then correct the
      parameters passed to the look-up frame in this instance.


E_AR0070_NotI4column "Column '%0c' is not a 4-byte integer\n


 Explanation:
      The sequence_value procedure was called for a column which is not a
      4-byte integer.

 System Status:
      A value of zero will be returned, indicating that no new value was
      generated.

 Recommendation:
      Either change the table definition or remove the call to sequence_value.


E_AR0071_BadMaxGet "Errors occurred reading the current maximum value.\n


 Explanation:
      Database errors occurred trying to determine the maximum value of the
      specified column.

 System Status:
      A value of zero will be returned, indicating that no new value was
      generated.

 Recommendation:
     Determine the cause of the errors and eliminate them.


E_AR0072_NoSqv_Parameter        "The parameter '%0c' is missing.\n


 Explanation:
      Either the table_name or column_name were not passed to the
      sequence_value procedure, or an empty string was passed.

 System Status:
      A value of zero will be returned, indicating that no new value was
      generated.

 Recommendation:
      Specify valid table and column names.


E_AR0073_BadSqvNumber   "The '%0c' argument must be positive.\n


 Explanation:
      Either the increment or start_value were passed in as a negative number
       or zero to the sequence_value procedure.

 System Status:
      A value of zero will be returned, indicating that no new value was
      generated.

 Recommendation:
      Specify valid values, or let them default to 1.


E_AR0074_Sqv_DBErr      "Database error(s) occurred in sequence_values\n


 Explanation:
      Database errors occurred while trying to access the ii_sequence_values
      table.

      generated.

 Recommendation:
      Determine why the errors occurred, and eliminate them.


E_AR0075_NoSuchTable    "Table '%0c' does not exist\n


 Explanation:
    The specified table does not exist.

 System Status:
      A value of zero will be returned, indicating that no new value was
      generated.

 Recommendation:
      Create the table, or correct the call to sequence_value.


E_AR0076_ReqTFQueryMode "Warning:  Table field not in query mode.\n


 Parameters:
      %0c     the name of the currently running form.
      %1c     the name of the table field which was qualified upon

 Explanation:
      When a table field is in query mode, both values and operators can be
      entered into its columns.  These values and operators can then be used
      to build a query using the 4GL qualification predicate.  No
      qualification predicate can be constructed when the table field is
      not in query mode.

 System Status:
      The query will be executed, but the qualifications upon the table field
      will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
      Make sure the mode of the table field is set to query (using the
      SET_FORMS or INITTABLE statement from 4GL) whenever a qualification
      predicate involving it is used for a query.


E_AR0080_StartObjNotFound       "Starting frame or procedure not found\n


 Explanation:
      You have requested that an imaged ABF application be started
      at a specific frame or procedure, but it could not be found.

 System Status:
      The application will terminate.

 Recommendation:
      Restart the application, specifying a starting frame or procedure
      that exists.


E_AR0081_StartProcNotFound      "Starting procedure not found\n


 Explanation:
      You have requested that an imaged ABF application be started
      at a specific procedure, but it could not be found.

      The application will terminate.

 Recommendation:
      Restart the application, specifying a starting frame or procedure
      that exists.


E_AR0082_BatchStartFrame        "Starting frame requires forms mode\n


 Explanation:
      You have requested that an imaged ABF application be started
      at a specific frame, but you have also requested that the
      application not be started in forms mode.  Frames require
      forms mode.

 System Status:
      The application will terminate.

 Recommendation:
      Restart the application, specifying a starting procedure rather than
      a starting frame, or else don't request that the application not be
      started in forms mode.


E_AR0083_BatchCallframe         "Callframe requires forms mode\n


 Explanation:
      The application has issued a CALLFRAME statement, but you have
      requested that the application not be started in forms mode.
      Frames require forms mode.

 System Status:
      The application will terminate.

 Recommendation:
      Don't request that the application not be started in forms mode,
      or start the application specifying a different starting procedure
      that won't issue any CALLFRAME statements,
      or revise the application to ensure that the starting procedure
      you specified won't issue any CALLFRAME statements.


E_AR0084_CalledProcNotFound     "Called procedure not found\n


 Explanation:
      The application has issued a CALLPROC statement,
      but the requested procedure could not be found.
      Since you have requested that the application not be started
      in forms mode, you will not be prompted for a different procedure
      to call.

 System Status:
      The application will terminate.

 Recommendation:
      Revise the application to ensure that the CALLPROC statement
      specifies a procedure that exists.


E_AR0085_OLpcall_failed "Host Language Procedure call failed\n


 Explanation:
      On Unix, this means that the maximum number of arguments allowed
      to be passed has been exceeded. On VMS it could mean that, or it
      could mean that there was some problem passing some argument to
      the Host Language Procedure.

 System Status:
      The Host Language Procedure was not called. Execution continues.

 Recommendation:
      Change the application to pass fewer arguments. A good target for
      number of args to pass would be less than 40 for Unix, less than
      256 for VMS.

 Explanation:
	The code generator could not open the file specified on the command-line
	(passed by ABF) into which it will generate C code for a frame/procedure
	object.  This could be for several reasons, but most likely is because
	you do not have access rights either to the directory in which the file
	is to be created (usually the ABF object code directory) or to the
	output file if it already exists, or because you have exceeded the disk
	space available to you in that directory.

 System Status:
	The code generator will terminate immediately with a FAIL status.  No
	object file will be produced for this frame/procedure.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that the you have both access rights to the ABF object code

E_CT0025_Bad_paramfile


 Explanation:
    Convtouni can accept parameters from a parameter file containing
    input parameters listed one per line. When this flag is specified
    do not provide any other flags or options. All the flags should be
    in the parameter file.

 System Status:
    Program terminates.

 Recommendation:
    Remove the extra flags and specify then inside the parameter file.


E_CT0026_Out_of_memory


E_CU0001_UNKNOWN_CLASS	"Internal Error: Unknown record type.\n


 Explanation:
	An illegal record type was some how generated
	in the copy frontend object utility.  This is
	an internal error and should be reported.
 System Status:
	This particular object will be ignored, but processing
	will continue.
 Recommendation:
	Report this problem.  Save the input file to
	document the problem.


E_CU0002_CANNOT_READ_FILE "Can't open file `%0c' for reading.\n"


 Explanation:
    	The file couldn't be open to process it.
 System Status:
   	 The problem will terminate.
 Recommendation:
	Make sure that the file exists and is readable by you.


E_CU0003_NO_GBF	"No GBF in this database.\n


 Explanation:
	As of 6.0, GBF is no longer a supported product.  Only
	some pre 6.0 database have the catalogs needed to support
	GBF.  In this case, the input file contained a GBF graph,
	but no GBF catalogs exist.
 System Status:
	The GBF graph will be ignored.
 Recommendation:
	If you think you should have GBF, check with your
	Site Technical Contact.


E_CU0004_CANNOT_CONVERT_FILE "Cannot convert file to 6.0 format.\n


 Explanation:
	There was an error converting the input file to 6.0 format.
	An earlier message should should have give a reason
	why the conversion failed.
 System Status:
	The program will terminate.
 Recommendation:
	Correct the earlier error.  If no error was given, save
	the input file and the output file named in the error
	and notify your Site Technical Contact.


E_CU0005_NO_CONVERT_FUNCTION "Cannot convert file to 6.0 format.\n


 Explanation:
	The input file is not of the correct format for this version
	of the program and it does not have a function to convert
	it.  This is either an internal problem in the program
	or it is a bad file.
 System Status:
	The program will terminate.
 Recommendation:
	Make sure the file is the proper format for the program
	begin run.


E_CU0008_OUT_OF_ORDER "The copy file contains a bad line.\n


 Explanation:
	The input file had a bad line in it.  This usually represents
	a problem in the copy program.

	can diagnosis the problem.


E_CU0009_NO_SUCH_GRAPH "Graph `%0c' not found.\n


 Explanation:
	The graph could not be found to copy out.
 System Status:
	The program will not copy this object.
 Recommendation:
	Enter the name of a correct graph.


E_CU000A_NOT_COMPATIBLE	"Incompatible file version.\n


 Explanation:
	The version of the file is from a release later than that of the copy
	utility being used to copy it into the database.  Since the file
	contains data for features not yet supported by this release that
	includes this copy utility, it cannot be copied into the database.

 System Status:
	The copy utility will terminate without copying the file.

 Recommendation:
	Your system administrator must upgrade your INGRES release to the
	version compatible with the system from which the file was copied.
	Please contact your system administrator.


E_CU0010_BAD_ENCODE "The entry  in the file for `%1c' `%0c' is bad.\n


 Explanation:
	The copy input file contain a bad line.
 System Status:
	The program will ignore this object and try to
	proceed.
 Recommendation:
	Save the copy file and report the problem to your
	Site Technical Contact.


E_CU0011_BAD_SAVE	"Could not save the `%1c' `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	An encoded object was trying to be saved in the database
	but couldn't.  A previous error should give the reason why.
	If not, report this to your Site Technical Contact.
 System Status:
	The program will ignore this object and try to proceed.
 Recommendation:
	If no previous error was given explaining why the save failed,
	please report this to your Site Technical Contact.


E_CU0012_BAD_ENCODE_END "The entry in the file for `%1c' `%0c' is bad.\n


 Explanation:
	The copy input file contain a bad line.
 System Status:
	The program will ignore this object and try to
	proceed.
 Recommendation:
	Save the copy file and report the problem to your
	Site Technical Contact.


 Explanation:
	Copyapp has encountered a Vision system catalog while copying an
	application into an ABF-only environment.
 System Status:
	The program will not attempt to copy this table into the destination
	database and will move on to the next line of the intermediate file.
 Recommendation:
	If you think the destination database should contain the Vision
	catalogs, report the problem to your site technical contact. Otherwise
	no action is necessary.


E_CU0013_BAD_FORMAT "The intermediate file has an invalid format.\n


 Explanation:
	Copyapp has discovered, while attempting to copy in, that the first
	line of the intermediate file has a bad format.
 System Status:
	The program will exit.
 Recommendation:
	Check the intermediate file to see whether it really is a copyapp
	intermediate file, and, if necessary, run 'copyapp out' again to
	create a new one.


E_CU0015_OLD_VERSION "Incompatible file version.\n


 Explanation:
	The version of the copyapp intermediate file is 5.0 or earlier.
	From 6.5, we no longer attempt to convert old files to 6.0 format.
 System Status:
	The program will exit.
 Recommendation:
	Running an earlier version of copyapp (6.0-6.4) will convert the
	intermediate file and copy the application into the system catalogs.

 Explanation:
	This occurs if a bad prefix is given on the command line or
	in the prompt, and no matching class of frontend objects
	corresponds to the prefix.

 System Status:
	This parameter will be skipped.

 Recommendation:
	Specify the correct prefix and rerun command.


E_DE0002_NotDBA "Only the DBA may use the -c flag.\n


 Explanation:

E_DD0006_CANT_INIT_CLITABLE  "Cannot initialize product table.\n


E_DD0007_NO_CLIENT "There is no front-end product with the name '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	There is no *.cli (i.e. the file suffix is "cli") file in the
	'dictfiles' subdirectory of the ingres files directory for a
	dictionary product with this name (the .cli files describe
	each product and which dictionary modules it requires).
	The first line of each .cli file gives the name of the dictionary
	product described in the file.

 System Status:
	Upgradefe will continue and process any other product names
	on the command line

 Recommendation:
	Make sure you have spelled the product name correctly on
	the command line and if so, make sure that you have a
	complete set of dictionary files in the directory mentioned
	above in the Explanation. If you are missing any files, then
	reload a fresh set from the Ingres distribution tape.


E_DD001E_NO_CLIENT_VERS


 Explanation:
	There is no *.cli (i.e. the file suffix is "cli") file in the
	'dictfiles' subdirectory of the ingres files directory for a
	dictionary product with this name and version number (the .cli
	files describe each product and which dictionary modules it requires).
	The first line of each .cli file gives the name and version
	number of the dictionary product described in the file.

 System Status:
	Upgradefe will continue and process any other product names
	on the command line

 Recommendation:
	Make sure you have spelled the product name correctly on
	the command line and if so, make sure that you have a
	complete set of dictionary files in the directory mentioned
	above in the Explanation. If you are missing any files, then
	reload a fresh set from the Ingres distribution tape.

E_DD0011_CANT_UPGRADE_MOD "Cannot upgrade to module %0c version %1d."


E_DD0026_CANT_UPGRADE_MOD2 "Cannot upgrade to module %0c version %1d.\n


 Explanation:
	An error occurred trying to upgrade a front-end dictionary module.
	The error number displayed could be from the operating system, or
	it could be an internal Ingres error number.

 System Status:
	Upgradefe exits with an error. Front-end catalogs are not upgraded.

 Recommendation:
	Check to see if the error number is an operating system error.


E_DD0019_DBMS_ERROR "DBMS error\n%0c\n"


E_DD001F_DBMS_ERROR2 "DBMS error:\n%0c\n occurred on the


E_DD0020_NO_UPGRADE_FILE "Could not find module upgrade program.\n


E_DD0025_NO_UPGRADE_FILE "Could not find module upgrade program.\n


 Explanation:
	Upgradefe was not able to find a required upgrade executable in the
	Ingres Bin directory.

 System Status:
	The upgrade is not performed.

 Recommendation:
	Check file permissions, and check if the file listed in the
	message exists.


E_DD0027_NOT_DBA	"Only the DBA can %0c a database.\n


 Explanation:
	Only the DBA for a database can upgrade or modify the database.
	The system administrator may become the DBA by specifying the -u
	flag.

 System Status:
	The upgrade is not performed.

 Recommendation:
	Log in as the DBA for the database you wish to upgrade or modify,
	or contact the INGRES System Administrator and have them run
	upgradefe or modifyfe for you.


E_DD0028_BAD_PAGESIZE	"The page size '%0d' is invalid or the dbms is not configured for this page size."


E_DD001A_II_DICTFILES_NOT_DIR "The variable 'II_DICTFILES' does not contain the name of a directory."


E_DD001B_NO_DB_PRIV "Not authorized\n


 Explanation:
	This user is not the DBA for the database, and is also not
	an Ingres super-user (this user is not allowed to use the -u flag to
	impersonate other users). Only a database's DBA and Ingres super-users
	are allowed to run this program on a database.

 System Status:
	The catalogs in the database have not been affected. It is as if
	this program was never run.

 Recommendation:
	Contact the DBA for the database or an Ingres super-user and have
	them run this program for you.


E_DD001C_NO_CLIENTS_SPEC "No products have been specified.\n"


E_DD0022_TOO_MANY_STAR_STMTS	"Star: Too many CREATE, DROP, MODIFY stmts\n

E_DD001D_CANT_GET_DB_TYPE "Cannot determine database or gateway type."


E_E00001_hcDEFINE	"The #define statement may be used only with values, not names.\n


 Explanation:
	The #define directive accepts only integer, floating point or string
	literals as the replacement token.  You may not use arbitrary text as
	the replacement token.  To define type names you should use typedef.
	The embedded preprocessor #define is not as versatile as
	the C #define.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E00002_hcIGNCAST	"Cast of #define value is ignored."


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor ignores a cast of the replacement value in a
	#define statement.  Casts in general are not supported by the
	embedded C preprocessor.

	Remove the cast from the #define statement.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E00003_hcINDIR	"Incorrect indirection on variable '%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when the address or value of a variable is
	incorrectly expressed because of faulty indirection.  For example,
	the name of an integer array has been given instead of a single
	array element, or, in the case of character string variables, a single
	element of the string (ie, a character) has been given instead
	of a pointer to the string or the name of the array.

	Either redeclare the variable with the intended indirection,
	or change its use in the current statement. 

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E00004_hcSTRUCTREF	"Last component of structure reference '%0c' is illegal."


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when the preprocessor encounters an unrecognized
	name in a structure reference.  The user may have incorrectly typed
	the name of structure element, or may have failed to declare it to the 
	preprocessor.

	Check for misspellings in component names and that all of the
	structure components have been declared to the preprocessor.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E00005_hcUNCLOSED	"Unclosed C block - %0c unbalanced left brace(s)."


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor reached the end of the file still expecting one or
	more closing curly braces '}'.  Make sure that you have no '{' in
	an unclosed character or string constant, or have not accidentally
	commented out a closing curly brace.  Also remember that the
	preprocessor ignores #ifdef directives, so having several '{' in
	alternate paths of an #ifdef will confuse the preprocessor.

	Balance curly braces declared to the preprocessor.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E00006_hcNOFUNCDEC	"Unsupported forward declaration of C function '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	(EQUEL)
	The preprocessor does not support function declarations.
	For example, the declaration:

	##	int func();

	will cause this error.

	Remove the ## mark from the function declaration.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E00007_hcNESTFUNCDEF	"Unsupported definition of nested C function '%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	(EQUEL)
	The preprocessor does not support nested function definitions.  This
	error commonly occurs when the user has omitted the ## mark on the
	closing brace of the previous function definition.

	Check that functions to be defined to the preprocessor have opening and
	closing braces.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E00008_hcVCHIGNRE	"Incorrect declaration of C varchar (or varbyte) variable is ignored.\n


 Explanation:
	Varchar or varbyte variables (variables declared with the varchar or
	varbyte storage class) must conform to an exact varying-length string 
	template so that INGRES can map to and from them at run-time.  The 
	length field must be exactly two-bytes (derived from a short), and 
	the character string field must be a single-dimensioned C character 
	array.  The varchar (or varbyte) clause must be associated with a 
	variable declaration and a not a type definition or structure tag 
	declaration.
	
	Check the varchar (or varbyte) structure declaration.  Make sure that 
	both structure members are declared properly.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E00009_hcMISSEQUAL	"Missing '=' in the initialization part of a C declaration."


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor allows automatic initialization of variables and
	expects the regular C syntax.

	Insert an equals sign between the variable and the initializing value.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E10001_hfBADTYPE	"Unsupported FORTRAN type '%0c' used.  DOUBLE assumed.\n


 Explanation:
	There is no INGRES type corresponding to COMPLEX or DOUBLE COMPLEX,
	so the preprocessor does not map this declaration to an INGRES type.

 System Status:
	The preprocessor will continue to generate code as if you had declared
	the variable in question to be of type DOUBLE PRECISION.
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Do not make this declaration visible to the preprocessor unless
	necessary.  If you want to store the two REAL (or DOUBLE PRECISION)
	components of a COMPLEX (or DOUBLE COMPLEX) variable then declare a
	pair of REAL (or DOUBLE PRECISION) variables to the preprocessor,
	copy the components to them, and then store the copies.


E_E10002_hfDEFINE	"FORTRAN PARAMETER may only be used with values.\n


 Explanation:
	You have used the FORTRAN "PARAMETER name = value" statement,
	but "value" is not an integer constant, a floating constant, or a
	string constant.  You may have used the name of a FORTRAN data type,
	or a variable (or PARAMETER) name instead of one of the legal constant
	types.

 System Status:
	The statement is ignored.
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Do not make this statement known to the preprocessor if you do not use
	the name being defined in any INGRES statement.  If you do wish INGRES
	to know about this name then you must change the "value" to be a
	constant.


E_E10003_hfINDIR	"Incorrect indirection on variable '%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when the value of a variable is
	incorrectly expressed because of faulty indirection.  For example,
	the name of an integer array has been given instead of a single
	array element, or, in the case of string variables, a single
	element of the string (ie, a character) has been given instead
	of the name of the array.

 System Status:
	The preprocessor will continue to generate code, but the program will
	not execute correctly if it is compiled and run.
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Either redeclare the variable with the intended indirection,
	or change its use in the current statement.


E_E10004_hfSTRUCTREF	"Last FORTRAN structure field referenced in '%0c' is unknown."


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when the preprocessor encounters an unrecognized
	name in a structure reference.

 System Status:
	The preprocessor will continue to generate code, but this statement
	will either cause a run-time error or produce the wrong result if
	the resulting program is compiled and run.
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Check for misspellings in field names and ensure that all of
	the structure fields have been declared to the preprocessor.


E_E10005_hfUNCLOSED	"Unclosed FORTRAN block - %0c unbalanced END(s)."


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor reached the end of the file still expecting one or
	more closing END statements.  Make sure that you have no 'ENDs' in an
	unclosed character or string constant, or have not accidentally
	commented out a closing END.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Balance each PROGRAM, PROCEDURE, or FUNCTION statement with a closing
	END.


E_E10006_hfNESTFUNCDEF	"Unsupported definition of nested FORTRAN function '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	EQUEL read the beginning of a subprogram (PROGRAM, PROCEDURE, or
	FUNCTION) while still in a previous subprogram definition.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Ensure that the END statement for a previous subprogram definition is
	not missing.  PASCAL programmers should remember that FORTRAN does
	not allow nested subprogram definitions.


E_E10007_hfDECLARE	"No ## DECLARE before first EQUEL/FORTRAN statement '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	You must issue a ## DECLARE statement lexically before any INGRES
	statement.

 System Status:
	The generated will probably not compile.
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Issue a DECLARE statement anywhere a declaration would be legal
	before you issue any INGRES statement.


E_E10008_hfREDECLARE	"Reissue of ## DECLARE in FORTRAN program unit.\n


 Explanation:
	The DECLARE statement should be issued exactly once in each FORTRAN
	program unit.  This can also be caused by forgetting to ## the
	PROGRAM, PROCEDURE, or FUNCTION line (and the matching END).

 System Status:
	EQUEL will ignore the extraneous DECLARE statement.
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the extra DECLARE statement, or ## the subprogram head
	and END.


E_E10009_hfDECFORMS	"No ## DECLARE FORMS before forms statement '%0c' in FORTRAN program unit."


 Explanation:
	You must issue a ## DECLARE FORMS statement lexically before any FORMS
	statement.

 System Status:
	The generated will probably not compile.
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Issue a DECLARE FORMS statement anywhere a declaration would be legal
	before you issue any FORMS statement.


E_E1000A_hfNOSTRUCT	"Undefined structure name '%0c' used in RECORD declaration."


 Explanation:
	You have declared a RECORD variable using the name of a STRUCTURE
	that is unknown to the preprocessor.

 System Status:
	The preprocessor will continue to generate code, but the resulting
	program will not run properly.
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	If you do not use this variable with an INGRES statement then
	remove the record declaration.  Otherwise ensure that the
	corresponding STRUCTURE declaration is made known to the preprocessor.


E_E1000B_hfELEM	"Field '%0c' in record '%1c' is not an elementary variable."


 Explanation:
	RECORD variables used in SQL as a single object must contain only
	scalar fields.  Arrays and nested records are not allowed in this
	context.

	Example:
	    EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION
		structure /object/
		    character*10	oname
		    integer		ovals(4)
		end structure
		record /object/	obj
	    EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION
	    EXEC SQL SELECT * INTO :obj FROM objects
	This will cause an error on "obj.oname", as it is an array variable.
		
 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Either flatten the record variable declaration or enumerate all
	fields when using the variable.


E_E1000C_hfBADSIZE	"Illegal length specified for FORTRAN numeric variable."


 Explanation:
	FORTRAN integer variables may be either 1, 2, or 4 bytes, and floating-
	point variables may be either 4 or 8 bytes.  Specifying any other
	value is illegal.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:


E_E1000D_hfNOSQLCODE	"SQLCODE has been declared, but the -sqlcode flag


 Explanation:
	Because the standard SQLCA include file declares an SQLCODE,
	which would duplicate the one you've just declared, you must 
	use the -sqlcode flag.  This flag tells the preprocessor that 
	the application has already declared an SQLCODE before it tries
	to include the SQLCA.

 System Status:
	You will likely get a multiply defined symbol error, either from 
	the fortran compiler or from the linker.

 Recommendation:
	recompile your application using the -sqlcode flag.  See the FORTRAN
	companion guide (and possibly the release notes) for information on 
	command line options.


E_E20001_hpBADATTRIB	"PASCAL attribute conflict in declaration of size for '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	The program has specified conflicting size attributes for this object.
	For example the following declaration is erroneous because of the
	attempt to extend the attribute size of the type 'smaller':

		type
			smaller = [byte] 1..100;
		var
			bigger  : [word] smaller;

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20002_hpBADSUBRANG	"PASCAL subrange conflict.\n


 Explanation:
	Both bounds of a subrange declaration must be of the same ordinal
	type (single character or integer).  If the subrange bounds types
	are different or if they are not ordinal types, the preprocessor will
	use the type of the second bound and accept the usage of variables
	declared with this subrange type.  This will cause an error in later
	PASCAL compilation.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20003_hpBLOCK	"Mismatching statement at end of PASCAL subprogram.\n


 Explanation:

	(ESQL)
	You may have an EXEC SQL END statement that is not balanced by a
	EXEC SQL LABEL statement.  These subprogram delimiters provide scoping
	for PASCAL labels generated by the preprocessor.  If you had syntax
	errors on the EXEC SQL LABEL statement then correct those errors and
	repreprocess the file.

	(EQUEL)
	You may have an END statement that is not balanced by a subprogram
	header (ie, PROGRAM, PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, or MODULE).  These subprogram
	delimiters provide scoping for PASCAL variables and labels generated
	by the preprocessor.  If you had any syntax errors on the subprogram
	header statement, then correct those errors and repreprocess the file.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20004_hpDECLARE	"No ## DECLARE before first EQUEL statement '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	(EQUEL)
	You must issue the ## DECLARE statement before the first embedded
	statement.  The preprocessor generates code that references procedures
	and functions declared within a file included by the ## DECLARE
	statement.  Without issuing the ## DECLARE statement, the PASCAL
	compiler will not accept those references.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20005_hpDIMSBAD	"PASCAL character array '%0c' must be PACKED or VARYING."


 Explanation:
	A string referenced in an embedded statement must be either a PACKED
	ARRAY OF CHAR, a VARYING OF CHAR or a single CHAR.  You have used
	a non-packed ARRAY OF CHAR as an embedded string variable.  Convert
	the variable declaration to either PACKED or VARYING, or subscript
	the array to reference only one element.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20006_hpEXTRASEMI	"Extraneous semicolon in PASCAL declaration ignored."


 Explanation:
	Only one semicolon is allowed between components of a record
	declaration.  The preprocessor ignores the extra semicolons.  You
	should delete the extra semicolon in your source code.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20007_hpINDEX	"PASCAL dimension of '%0c' is %1c, but subscripted %2c times."


 Explanation:
	You have not referenced the specified variable with the same number
	of subscripts as the number of dimensions with which the variable
	was declared.  This error indicates that you have failed to
	subscript an array, or you have subscripted a non-array.  The
	preprocessor does not parse declaration dimensions or subscript
	expressions.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20008_hpINDIR	"Incorrect indirection of PASCAL variable '%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when the address or value of a variable is
	incorrectly expressed because of faulty indirection.  For example,
	the name of an integer pointer has been given instead of the variable
	that the pointer was pointing at.  Either redeclare the variable
	with the intended indirection (and check any implicit indirection
	in the type), or change its use in the current statement. 

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20009_hpLBINC	"PASCAL Pass 2 failure on INCLUDE file.\n


 Explanation:
	The PASCAL preprocessor must take a second pass in order to declare
	implicitly generated labels.  If the source file referenced embedded
	INCLUDE files, then the second pass needs to generate labels into
	those files.  Consequently there is a maximum nexting limit of INCLUDE
	files.  Try reorganizing your files to create a flatter source file
	structure.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E2000A_hpLBNONE	"No ## PROCEDURE for current scope but labels have been generated."


 Explanation:
	(EQUEL - See hpLBSQNONE for ESQL)
	The PASCAL preprocessor must take a second pass in order to declare
	implicitly generated labels.  If labels were implicitly generated
	then the preprocessor needs to know where to declare them on the second
	pass.  That is why one must precede subprogram headers (PROGRAM,
	PROCEDURE, FUNCTION and MODULE) with ##, or use the LABEL statement.
	If you did not declare your subprogram header to the preprocessor, the
	generated labels will be marked as undeclared by the PASCAL compiler.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E2000B_hpLBPASS2	"PASCAL Pass 2 open file failure.\n


 Explanation:
	The PASCAL preprocessor must take a second pass in order to declare
	implicitly generated labels.  Because there is a temporary file
	involved, and this file has a fixed name, you should avoid
	running the preprocessor more than once in the same directory.
	This error may also occur if the intermediate file disappeared, the
	system protections of the current directory are too restrictive
	or have changed, or if the original input file was moved between the
	first and second pass of the preprocessor.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E2000C_hpLBSYNC	"PASCAL Pass 2 file inconsistency.\n


 Explanation:
	The PASCAL preprocessor must take a second pass in order to declare
	implicitly generated labels.  There was a difference between the
	number of label declaration sections the preprocessor expected to 
	generate and the number of markers found in the intermediate file.
	This may be caused by an embedded INCLUDE statement that requires
	its own scope for label generation.  If there were nested INCLUDE
	statements whose files required labels, try to flatten them out into
	larger source files.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E2000D_hpMISSING	"Missing PASCAL keyword '%0c' in declaration."


 Explanation:
	You did not use the specified keyword, or you did not make the word
	known to the preprocessor. If there are no other errors the
	preprocessor will generate correct PASCAL code.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E2000E_hpNESTUNIT	"Illegal nesting of PASCAL compilation units."


 Explanation:
	(EQUEL)
	You may not nest modules and programs within themselves or each
	other.  Make sure you have placed the ## mark before the END
	statement for programs and modules.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E2000F_hpNOINDIR	"Can not use indirection (^) on an undeclared PASCAL variable '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	You have used pointer indirection on a name that was not declared as
	a PASCAL variable to the preprocessor.  If this really is a variable you
	should make its declaration known to the preprocessor.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20010_hpNOSUBSCR	"Can not subscript ([]) an undeclared PASCAL variable '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	You have used array subscription on a name that was not declared as
	a PASCAL variable to the preprocessor.  If this really is a variable you
	should make its declaration known to the preprocessor.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20011_hpNOTPACKED	"Can not subscript VARYING PASCAL variable '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	Elements of a varying-length character string array cannot be passed
	to the run-time system.  If you need to pass a single element then
	declare the array as a plain array (not PACKED nor VARYING).

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20012_hpNOTSCALTYP	"Scalar PASCAL type required for conformant schema bounds type."


 Explanation:
	PASCAL requires that bounds expressions of conformant arrays be of
	a scalar type.  You must choose a scalar type, such as a single
	character or an integer.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20013_hpNOTVAR	"PASCAL object '%0c' is not a variable."


 Explanation:
	You have used the specified name as an embedded variable, but you
	have not declared it to the preprocessor.  This may also be a scope
	problem.  Make sure you have typed the name correctly, declared the
	variable to the preprocessor and have used it within its scope.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20014_hpOVERFLOW	"Too many comma separated names in declaration.\n


 Explanation:
	The declaration of a comma-separated list of names in a declaration
	is too long.   For example:
		
		var
			a, b, ..... N : Integer;

	Try breaking up the declaration into groups.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20015_hpPARAM	"EQUEL/PASCAL does not support PARAM target lists."


 Explanation:
	(EQUEL)
	If you need to use PARAM target lists, then you should write this
	subprogram in another host language (C, FORTRAN, PL/I) and link
	that module with you PASCAL program.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20016_hpREDECLARE	"Reissue of ## DECLARE statement. Second time is ignored."


 Explanation:
	The ## DECLARE statement should occur only once per module.  Placing
	the statement after an EQUEL statement will also cause this error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20017_hpSEMIMISS	"Missing semicolon (;) at end of PASCAL LABEL declaration list."


 Explanation:
	(EQUEL)
	Earlier version of EQUEL/PASCAL did not require the use of the
	semicolon after the LABEL statement.  The preprocessor now requires
	the terminating semicolon if you include a list of your own labels
	with the LABEL statement.  If you do not include the semicolon, the
	preprocessor will generate correct code, but you should still correct
	the error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20018_hpSTRUCTREF	"Last PASCAL record member referenced in '%0c' is unknown."


 Explanation:
	The last record member referenced is not a member of the current
	record.  Make sure you have spelled the member name correctly, and
	that it is a member of the specified record.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20019_hpUNCLOSED	"Unclosed PASCAL block.\n


 Explanation:
	The end of the file was reached with some program blocks left

	exception.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E2001B_hpUNDERFLOW	"Underflow of comma separated name list in declaration."


 Explanation:
	The stack used to store comma separated names in declarations has
	been corrupted.  Try rearranging the list of names in the declaration.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E2001C_hpUNSUPP	"PASCAL variable '%0c' is of unsupported type SET or QUADRUPLE."


 Explanation:
	You may declare variables of type SET And QUADRUPLE, but you may not
	use them in embedded statements.  The declarations are only allowed
	so that you can declare records with components of those types.  If
	those variables need to interact with INGRES, then declare the SET
	variable as an ARRAY OF BOOLEAN, and the QUADRUPLE variable as a DOUBLE.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E2001D_hpWTHNULL	"Adding an unknown name '%0c' in PASCAL WITH statement."


 Explanation:
	(EQUEL)
	The specified name is not known to the preprocessor when used with

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E2001F_hpWTHOPEN	"A PASCAL WITH block is still open."


 Explanation:
	(EQUEL)
	Every WITH block must be closed by an END statement.  This error

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E20023_hpLBSQNONE	"No embedded LABEL statement for current scope but labels have been generated."


 Explanation:
	(ESQL - See hpLBNONE for EQUEL)
	The PASCAL preprocessor must take a second pass in order to declare
	implicitly generated labels.  If labels were implicitly generated
	then the preprocessor needs to know where to declare them on the second
	pass.  That is why one must issue the embedded LABEL statement
	(and corresponding END statement) in each subprogram that issues an
	embedded block-structured statement.  If you did not issue the EXEC

	cannot be mixed.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E30003_hbNESTDEF	"Nested BASIC DEF statements are not allowed."


 Explanation:
	(EQUEL)
	Nested DEF statements are not supported by the preprocessor.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E30004_hbSINGDEF	"Single-line BASIC DEF statements are not allowed."


 Explanation:

 Recommendation:


E_E3001D_hbNOSQLCODE   "SQLCODE has been declared, but the -sqlcode flag


 Explanation:
      Because the standard SQLCA include file declares an SQLCODE,

      companion guide (and possibly the release notes) for information on
      command line options.


E_E3001E_hbSINGLE    "The SINGLE datatype is unsupported on AlphaVMS, 


 Explanation:
      Only IEEE float data types are supported on Alpha VMS. SINGLE is 
      not an IEEE float data type.

 System Status:
      The BASIC pre-processor will flag a SINGLE data type specification
      as an error message.  It must be changed before the BASIC program
      can be pre-processed.

 Recommendation:
      Update all references to the SINGLE data type to SFLOAT as this is
      the equivalent IEEE data type.


E_E3001F_hbDOUBLE    "The DOUBLE datatype is unsupported on AlphaVMS, 


 Explanation:
      Only IEEE float data types are supported on Alpha VMS. DOUBLE is 
      not an IEEE float data type.

 System Status:
      The BASIC pre-processor will flag a DOUBLE data type specification
      as an error message.  It must be changed before the BASIC program
      can be pre-processed.

 Recommendation:
      Update all references to the DOUBLE data type to TFLOAT as this is
      the equivalent IEEE data type.


E_E40001_hcbAMBIG	"Ambiguous qualification of COBOL data item '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	This data item is not sufficiently qualified in order to distinguish
	it from another data item.  It is likely that that the data item
	is an elementary member of a COBOL record or group.  To avoid 
	reference ambiguity qualify the data item further by using IN or OF.
	When using COBOL table subscripts (via parenthesis), the subscripted
	item must be unambiguous when the left parenthesis is processed.

	The preprocessor will generate code using the most recently declared
	instance of the ambiguous data item.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40002_hcbBAD	"Unsupported COBOL numeric PICTURE string '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	An invalid picture character was encountered while processing a
	numeric picture string.  A numeric picture string may include:

		'S', '9', '(', ')' and 'V'

	The preprocessor will treat the data item as though it was declared:

		PICTURE S9(8) USAGE COMP.
		
 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40003_hcbCOMPLEN	"COMP picture '%0c' requires too many storage bytes.\n


 Explanation:
	The COMPUTATIONAL data type must fit into a maximum of 4 bytes.
	Numeric integers of more than 9 digits require VAX quad-word integer
	storage (8 bytes), which is incompatible with the INGRES internal
	run-time data types.  Try reducing the picture string or declaring
	the data item as COMP-3 or COMP-2 which is compatible with INGRES
	floating point data.

	An exception is made to allow non-scaled 10-digit numeric picture
	strings (PICTURE S(10) USAGE COMP), which is representable by a
	4-byte integer.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40004_hcbDECLARE	"No ## DECLARE before first EQUEL statement '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	You must issue the ## DECLARE statement before the first embedded
	statement.  The preprocessor generates code that references data
	items declared within a file copied by the ## DECLARE statement.
	Without issuing the ## DECLARE statement, the COBOL compiler will
	not accept those references.
	
 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40005_hcbELEM	"'%0c' is not an elementary data item. Records cannot be used."


 Explanation:
	Within this usage, COBOL records or tables cannot be used. In order
	to use this data item you must refer to an elementary data item that
	is a member of the record, or an element of the COBOL table.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40006_hcbLEVEL	"COBOL declaration level %0c is out of bounds."


 Explanation:
	Only levels 01 through 49 and 77 are accepted for COBOL data item
	declarations.  Level numbers outside of this range will be treated
	as though they are level 01.

	Syntax errors caused within leading clauses of a COBOL declaration
	may cascade and generate this error message for the OCCURS and VALUE
	clauses of the erroneous declaration.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40007_hcbNEEDPIC	"Data item requires a PICTURE string in this USAGE."


 Explanation:
	The specified USAGE clause requires a COBOL PICTURE string in order
	to determine preprocessor data item type information.  Not all USAGE
	clauses require a PICTURE string.  Data items with USAGE COMP, COMP-3
	and DISPLAY do require a PICTURE string.  If no PICTURE string is
	specified the preprocessor will treat the data item as though it
	was declared:

		PICTURE X(10) USAGE DISPLAY.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40008_hcbNOPAR	"Data item on level %0c has no parent of lesser level."


 Explanation:
	A data item declared on a level that is greater than the level of the
	most recently declared data item is considered to be a subordinate
	member of that group.  The previous level, therefore, must be the level
	number of a COBOL record or group declaration.  This is typical with
	a COBOL record containing a few elementary data items.

	A data item declared on a level that is less than the level of the
	most recently declared data item is considered to be on the same level
	as the "parent" of that data item.

	Level numbers violating this rule will be treated as though they 
	are level 01.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40009_hcbNOPIC	"Keyword PICTURE and the describing string must be on the same line."


 Explanation:
	When the preprocessor scans the COBOL PICTURE string, it must find
	the PICTURE key word and the corresponding string description
	on the same line in the source file.  The PICTURE word and the
	string may be separated by the IS key word.  The preprocessor will treat
	the declaration as though there was no PICTURE clause.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E4000A_hcbNOVAR	"'%0c' is not a legally declared data item."


 Explanation:
	The specified data item must has not been declared but has been
	used in place of a COBOL variable within an embedded statement.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E4000B_hcbNUMDISPLAY	"Unsupported PICTURE '%0c' is numeric-display.\n


 Explanation:
	Some versions of the COBOL preprocessor do not support numeric
	display data items.  For example:

		PICTURE S9(8) USAGE DISPLAY.

	If this is the case, you should use COMPUTATIONAL data items and
	assign to and from DISPLAY items before using the data item within
	embedded statements.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E4000C_hcbOCCURS	"COBOL OCCURS clause is not allowed on level 01."


 Explanation:
	The OCCURS clause must be used with a data item that is declared
	on a level greater than 01.  This error is only a warning, and 
	treats the data item correctly (as though declared as a COBOL table).
	A warning may also be generated by the COBOL compiler.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E4000D_hcbPARAM	"EQUEL/COBOL does not support PARAM target lists."


 Explanation:
	This feature is not documented and should not be used with EQUEL
	COBOL.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E4000E_hcbPICLONG	"PICTURE '%0c' is too long.  The maximum length is %1c."


 Explanation:
	COBOL PICTURE strings must not exceed the maximum length specified
	in the error message.  Try to collapse consecutive occurrences of
	the same PICTURE symbol into a "repeat count".  For example:
		
		PICTURE S99999999 becomes PICTURE S9(8)

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E4000F_hcbPICNUM	"PICTURE '%0c' contains non-integer repeat count, %1c."


 Explanation:
	A COBOL "repeat count" within a PICTURE string was either too long 
	or was not an integer.  The preprocessor treats the data item as
	though declared with a PICTURE with a repeat count of 1.  For example:

		S9(1) or X(1).


 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40010_hcbREDECLARE	"Reissue of ## DECLARE. Second time ignored."


 Explanation:
	Unused Error!


 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40011_hcbUSAGE	"USAGE type '%0c' is not supported."


 Explanation:
	This usage type is currently not supported.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40012_hcbS2PIC	"PICTURE '%0c' has two sign symbols (S)."


 Explanation:
	The specified numeric PICTURE string has two sign symbols.
	The preprocessor will treat the data item as though it was declared:

		PICTURE S9(8) USAGE COMP.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40013_hcbV2PIC	"PICTURE '%0c' has two decimal point symbols (V)."


 Explanation:
	The specified numeric PICTURE string has two decimal point symbols.
	The preprocessor will treat the data item as though it was declared:

		PICTURE S9(8) USAGE COMP.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40014_hcbCONTIN	"Missing quotation mark on continued string literal."


 Explanation:
	The first non-blank character of a continued string literal must
	be a quotation mark in the indicator area.  A missing quotation mark
	in the continued string literal or the wrong quotation mark will
	generate this error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40015_hcbMUSTINDIR	"COBOL data item '%0c' is a table and must be subscripted."


 Explanation:
	The data item is a COBOL table and must be subscripted in order to 
	yield an elementary data item to retrieve or set INGRES data.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40016_hcbCANTINDIR	"COBOL data item '%0c' is not a table and must not be subscripted."


 Explanation:
 	You have included subscripts when referring to a data item that was
	not declared as a COBOL table.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40017_hcbDUPL	"Duplicate COBOL data declaration '%0c' clause found."


 Explanation:
 	You have included either a duplicate USAGE, PICTURE, or OCCURS data
	declaration clause when declaring a data item.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E40018_hcbNOSQLCODE	"SQLCODE has been declared, but the -sqlcode flag


 Explanation:
      Because the standard SQLCA include file declares an SQLCODE,
      which would duplicate the one you've just declared, you must
      use the -sqlcode flag.  This flag tells the preprocessor that
      the application has already declared an SQLCODE before it tries
      to include the SQLCA.

 System Status:
      You will likely get a multiply defined symbol error, either from
      the fortran compiler or from the linker.

 Recommendation:
      recompile your application using the -sqlcode flag.  See the COBOL
      companion guide (and possibly the release notes) for information on
      command line options.


E_E60001_haMUSTINDIR	"The ADA variable '%0c' is an array and must be subscripted."


E_E60002_haCANTINDIR	"The ADA variable '%0c' is not an array and must not be subscripted."


 Explanation:
	A variable not declared as an array cannot be subscripted.  You cannot
	subscript string variables in order to refer to a single character or
	a slice of a string (sub-string).

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E60003_haBADTYPE	"The ADA identifier '%0c' is not a declared type."


 Explanation:
	The identifier was used as an ADA type name in an object or type
	declaration.  This identifier has not yet been declared to the
	preprocessor and is not a preprocessor-predefined type name.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E60004_haCHARDIMS	"The ADA CHARACTER variable '%0c' must be a 1-dimensional array."


 Explanation:
	Variables of type CHARACTER can only be declared as 1-dimensional
	arrays.  You cannot use a single character or a multi-dimensional
	array of characters as an INGRES string.  Note that you can use a 
	multidimensional array of type STRING.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E60005_haDIGITS	"The ADA DIGITS clause '%0c' is out of the range 1..16."


 Explanation:
	Embedded ADA supports D_FLOAT floating point variables.  Consequently,
	all DIGITS specifications must be within the specified range.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E60006_haINCPKG	"Statement '%0c' is embedded in INCLUDE file package specification."


 Explanation:
	Preprocessor INCLUDE files may only be used for ADA package
	specifications.  The preprocessor generates an ADA WITH clause
	for the package. No executable statements may be included in the
	file because the code generated will not be accepted by the ADA
	compiler in a package specification.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E60007_haNMOVERFLOW	"Too many names (%0c) in ADA identifier list.  Maximum is %1c."


 Explanation:
	ADA identifier lists cannot have too many names in the comma-separated
	name list.  The name specified in the error message caused the
	overflow, and the remainder of the list is ignored.  Rewrite the
	declaration so that there are fewer names in the list.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E60008_haNMUNDERFLOW	"The ADA identifier list has come up short."


 Explanation:
	The stack used to store comma separated names in ADA declarations has
	been corrupted.  Try rearranging the list of names in the declaration.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E60009_haNOTINITED	"The ADA CONSTANT declaration of '%0c' must be initialized."


 Explanation:
	CONSTANT declarations must include an initialization clause.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E6000A_haNOTVAR	"The ADA identifier '%0c' is either a constant or an enumerated literal."


 Explanation:
	The named identifier was used to retrieve data from INGRES.  A constant,
	an enumerated literal and a formal parameter with the IN mode are
	all considered illegal for the purpose of retrieval.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E6000B_haBADRECALL	"The ADA variable '%0c' with '.ALL' clause is illegal."


 Explanation:
	The ADA .ALL clause, as specified with access objects, can be used only
	if the variable is an access object pointing at a single scalar-valued
	type.  If the type is not scalar valued, or if the access object is 
	pointing at a record or array, then the use of .ALL is illegal.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E6000C_haSCALRECALL	"The ADA variable '%0c' with '.ALL' clause is not a scalar type."


 Explanation:
	The ADA .ALL clause, as specified with access objects, can be used only
	if the variable is an access object pointing at a single scalar-valued
	type.  If the type is not scalar valued, or if the access object is 
	pointing at a record or array, then the use of .ALL is illegal.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E6000D_haRECORDREF	"Last component in ADA record qualification '%0c' is illegal."


 Explanation:
	The last component referenced in a record qualification is not a
	member of the record.  If this component was supposed to be declared
	as a record, the following components will cause preprocessor syntax
	errors.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E6000E_haRNMBAD	"In ADA RENAMES statement, '%0c' must be a constant or a variable."


 Explanation:
	The target object of a RENAMES statement must be a constant or a

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E60014_haVARRECORD	"The ADA variable '%0c' is a record, not a scalar value."


 Explanation:
	The named variable qualification refers to a record.  It was used
	where a variable must be used to set or retrieve INGRES data.  This
	error may also cause syntax errors on record component references.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E60015_haWITHEQUEL	"You must issue a '## WITH %0c' before statement '%1c'."


 Explanation:
	(EQUEL)
	If your compilation unit includes forms statements you must issue the
	WITH EQUEL_FORMS clause.  Otherwise you must issue the WITH EQUEL
	clause.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_E60016_haUNSUPP	"The ADA statement %0c is not supported."


 Explanation:
	Statements that modify the internal representation of variables
	that interact with INGRES are not supported.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0001_eqNOMEM	"Fatal memory allocation error in routine '%1c'.\n


 Explanation:
	A memory allocation or free error has occurred somewhere in
	the code in a place where it was unexpected, or where it
	was not possible to recover from the error.  This may indicate an
	internal coding error or a program that is too large. 

 System Status:
	The preprocessor will abort.

 Recommendation:
	Check your system quotas.  If you suspect they might be too low, 
	try to break up the input file or the embedded language blocks.
	If the preprocessor still fails, call your INGRES support person.


E_EQ0002_eqNOTABLE	"Fatal attempt to access internal table.\n


 Explanation:
	A required internal data structure could not be accessed.  This
	may be caused by an incorrectly linked preprocessor image or an
	internal coding error.

 System Status:
	The preprocessor will abort.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your INGRES support person.


E_EQ0003_eqNULL "Null type pointer in routine '%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	An internal symbol can not be accessed.   This may be caused by
	an internal coding error.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	If the preprocessor reported syntax errors, correct them and
	repreprocess your file.  If the error occurs again, contact your
	INGRES support person.


E_EQ0004_eqTRACEFL	"Conflicting %0c '-to' and '-tl' options."


 Explanation:
	This error is caused by an inconsistent use of the internal trace
	-t flag when invoking the preprocessor.  Under normal circumstances
	it should not be necessary to use trace flags.

 System Status:
	The preprocessor will exit without preprocessing the input file.

 Recommendation:
	Retype the preprocessor command line using the correct flags.


E_EQ0005_eqINFILE	"%0c input file '%1c' cannot be opened.\n


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor cannot find the input file named on the command
	line.  The location/directory path specified may be incorrect,
	the file name itself may be incorrectly entered, or the file may
	be non-existent.  An extremely long path name will also cause this
	error.
	
 System Status:
	The preprocessor will exit without preprocessing the input file.

 Recommendation:
	Retype the preprocessor command line correctly specifying the 
	input file.


E_EQ0006_eqOUTOPT	"Conflicting %0c '-f' options.\n


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when the -f flag is used twice on the command line,
	once without an argument and once with a file name.  For example:
		preproc -f -foutfilename
	Note that if the the -f flag is not used, the preprocessor will
	create an output file with the default name.
	
 System Status:
	The preprocessor will exit without preprocessing the input file.

 Recommendation:
	Select the appropriate output option and retype the preprocessor
	command line.


E_EQ0007_eqOUTFILE	"Cannot open %0c output file '%1c'.\n


 Explanation:
	Output files cannot be opened if a user does not have write
	privileges.  If the -f flag was specified, the location or directory
	path given must be a legal location.  There may be other system 
	dependent reasons why a file cannot be opened.

 System Status:
	The preprocessor will exit without preprocessing the input file.
	
 Recommendation:
	Attempt to open a file with the same name at the system level and take
	note of the system response.


E_EQ0008_eqLISTFILE	"Cannot open %0c listing file '%1c'.\n


 Explanation:
	The listing file is opened in the same directory as the input
	file, and the user must have write permission in this location.

E_EQ0051_grDISPTL	"DISPLAY statement target list is not supported.\n


 Explanation:
	The INGRES version 2.1 DISPLAY statement arguments (such as _FIELD
	and _TYPE) are no longer supported and you may not use a target
	list in a DISPLAY statement.  The INQUIRE_FRS statement allows you
	to retrieve the equivalent information.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the syntax of the DISPLAY statement in the embedded program.


E_EQ0052_grFMFUNC	"Illegal context for Forms '%0c' function.\n


 Explanation:
	The forms functions, such as GETOPER, which retrieves relational
	operators from fields and table fields, may be legally used as follows:
		GETFORM form (var = GETOPER(field), ...)
		GETROW form table [row] (var = GETOPER(column), ...)
	This also applies to the PUTOPER function.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the syntax of the current statement.


E_EQ0053_grFMINTFUNC	"Forms '%0c' function is integer valued.\n


 Explanation:
	The variable used to receive the result of the above FRS function 
	has a type other than integer.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the current syntax to use an integer variable which
	has been declared to the preprocessor.


E_EQ0054_grNOPARENS	"Empty parentheses are ignored.\n


 Explanation:
	Some statements have optional target lists.  In some cases, when
	empty target lists are used, this warning is displayed. 

 System Status:
	The preprocessor will ignore the parentheses and will return
	a SUCCESS status if no other errors occur during preprocessing.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the unnecessary parentheses.


E_EQ0055_grFMPARAM	"Illegal context for PARAM clause in forms statement.\n


 Explanation:
	In the languages that support PARAM target lists, not all forms 
	target lists have a PARAM equivalent.  The statements that have
	a PARAM equivalent are documented in the preprocessor manual.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Rewrite the forms target list using host variables declared to the
	preprocessor instead of the PARAM clause.


E_EQ0056_grFORMNAME	"Form name required for %0c statement.\n


 Explanation:
	A forms I/O statement that is syntactically outside of a DISPLAY
	loop requires a form name specification.   Inside the DISPLAY
	loop the currently displayed form is assumed if no form is
	specified.  This error may also occur if the DISPLAY statement
	contained a syntax error.
	
 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Check the syntax on the DISPLAY statement.  Otherwise, include a 
	form name in the statement, or move the statement inside a DISPLAY loop.


E_EQ0057_grHOSTVAR	"'%0c' expected to be a simple variable.\n


 Explanation:
	The named identifier was used in an I/O statement, but was not
	declared to the preprocessor as a scalar numeric or character
	string variable.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Declare the identifier as a variable to the preprocessor.


E_EQ0058_grINLOOP	"The %0c statement must be in a %1c loop.\n"


 Explanation:
	Some statements (such as ENDLOOP) that syntactically belong inside
	a specific loop or block cannot be issued outside the loop or
	or block, as they generate host language GOTO statements.  Also, a
	syntax error on the block or loop statement will cause this error
	to occur on subsequent statements.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Correct any bad syntax on the block (ie, DISPLAY) statement.
	Otherwise, move the statement producing the error inside the correct
	block statement.


E_EQ0059_grINT	"Integer variable, constant or literal expected.\n


 Explanation:
	The current statement requires an integer value or variable.  You 
	have used a non-integer variable or an identifier which has not been
	declared to the preprocessor as a variable.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Substitute an integer value or a variable which has been declared
	to the preprocessor.


E_EQ005A_grBYREF "BYREF parameters may not be coded in an EXECUTE PROCEDURE\n


 Explanation:
	The current statement is an EXECUTE PROCEDURE which contains both
	BYREF parameters and a RESULT ROW clause. This combination is not
	permitted.

	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the BYREF designation from all parameters if a RESULT ROW is
	being returned by the procedure.


E_EQ005B_grEXLOOP "An EXECUTE PROCEDURE loop may only be coded if the\n


 Explanation:
	The current statement is an EXECUTE PROCEDURE which includes a
	BEGIN/ENDEXECUTE block, but no RESULT ROW clause. The block may
	only be coded if the statement includes a RESULT ROW clause.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Either remove the BEGIN/ENDEXECUTE block or add a RESULT ROW 
	clause to the EXECUTE PROCEDURE statement.


E_EQ0060_grINTSTRVAR	"Integer or character string expected.\n


 Explanation:
	The current statement requires an integer or character string
	variable or value.  You have used a variable of some other type.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Substitute an integer or character string (variable or literal).


E_EQ0061_grINTVAR	"Type of variable '%0c' should be an integer.\n"


 Explanation:
	You have used a variable of some other type than integer.  The
	current statement requires the use of an integer variable.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Substitute an integer variable for the wrongly-typed variable.


E_EQ0062_grNAME	"Variable '%0c' used when name expected.\n


 Explanation:
	This is a common error in EQUEL, where an object name (ie, database
	column or form field) has the same name as a numeric variable.
	The preprocessor will never issue this error when a character string 
	variable is used because object names can be stored inside string 
	variables.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Dereferencing the variable with the # sign will cause the name
	to be used and not the contents of the named variable.


E_EQ0063_grNESTQUEL	"Illegal nesting of database statements.\n


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when a database query is coded within the
	scope of a database data retrieval loop statement (SELECT or RETRIEVE).
	The statements that may be placed within the data retrieval loop are
	forms statements, the INQUIRE/SET status statements and the loop break 
	statements (ENDSELECT or ENDRETRIEVE).

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Move the flagged statement outside the scope of the data retrieval
	loop.


E_EQ0064_grQRSTRVAR	"'%0c' expected to be a character string variable.\n


 Explanation:
	When replacing parts of a query, such as a WHERE clause, the
	specified replacement must be a string variable.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Replace the variable marked as an error with a string variable
	declared to the preprocessor.


E_EQ0065_grRETREPEAT	"Incorrect use of '@' on REPEAT statement variable.\n


 Explanation:
	A common error in the REPEAT RETRIEVE statement is to use the
	@ sign on result variable names.  The @ sign can only prefix variables
	to be sent to the database as constant values.  In the RETRIEVE case,
	the @ sign can be correctly used in the WHERE clause.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the @ sign from variables that do not replace QUEL constants.


E_EQ0066_grSTR	"String constant expected instead of '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	Either a numeric variable or an unquoted name was used instead
	of a string variable or quoted string.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Use quotation marks around the flagged name or a string variable.


E_EQ0067_grSTRVAR	"Object named '%0c' should be a character string variable."


 Explanation:
	The current statement requires the use of a character string variable
	to retrieve results or replace a string literal.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Substitute a character string variable, declared to the preprocessor,
	for the name flagged as an error.


E_EQ0068_grUNLOADTB	"Illegal nesting of UNLOADTABLE statements.\n


 Explanation:
	Because of run-time implementation considerations, an UNLOADTABLE
	statement cannot appear within the block of another UNLOADTABLE.
	Note that the dynamic nesting of UNLOADTABLE statements (ie, via
	a subroutine call) is also not allowed and will cause a run-time error.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Code UNLOADTABLE statements consecutively instead of nesting them.


E_EQ0069_grBADWORD	"Illegal word '%0c' in %1c statement.\n


 Explanation:
	Some statements have words that are reserved only within the
	context of the statement.  Misspelling or misplacing the word
	will generate the above message.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Update the statement to use the correct keyword.


E_EQ006A_grxBADWORD     "Illegal word '%0c' in %1c statement."


 Explanation:
      Some statements have words that are reserved only within the
      context of the statement.  Misspelling or misplacing the word
      will generate the above message.

 System Status:
      Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
      A "SYNTAX ERROR...." is generated in the source code.

 Recommendation:
      Update the statement to use the correct keyword.


E_EQ006B_WITH_NOCONS	"Constraint WITH clause doesn't follow constraint definition."


 Explanation:
      The UNIQUE/PRIMARY KEY/FOREIGN KEY constraint WITH clause must
	immediately follow the constraint definition. The syntax as coded
	in this statement is incorrect.

 System Status:
      Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
      A "SYNTAX ERROR...." is generated in the source code.

 Recommendation:
      Update the statement to properly use the constraint WITH clause.


E_EQ0070_grMISSWORD	"Missing word '%0c' in %1c statement."


 Explanation:
	Some statements have "noise" words or operators that are expected
	in some contexts.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
  	Update the statement to reflect the correct syntax.


E_EQ0071_grASSGNOP	"Assignment operator should be '=', not '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	This statement requires the use of the equals sign to indicate
	that the value from a field in a form is to be assigned to a 
	program variable.  Some older versions of the preprocessor allowed
	other words (IS, BY) in this context.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement to use the '=' assignment operator.


E_EQ0072_grNONULL	"Incorrect use of indicator variable.\n


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when a null indicator is used with a variable 
	or identifier representing an object name.  Null indicators may be 
	used only on I/O statements in conjunction with program variables
	transmitting data.  Their purpose is to send/receive null data
	to or from the database or a form .

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the flagged null indicator from the current statement.


E_EQ0073_grINDVAR	"Indicator variable '%0c' must be a 2-byte integer."


 Explanation:
	You have used an indicator variable which is either a non-integer
	or is the wrong size.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Use an indicator variable which has been declared to the preprocessor
	as a 2-byte integer.


E_EQ0074_grMISVAR	"Incorrect use of variable '%0c' in '%1c' statement."


 Explanation:
	You have used a variable together with names or string literals
	in a context where the preprocessor expects either a single 
	character variable, a string literal, or one or more unquoted
	identifiers.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the syntax so that the clause in question appears as
	unquoted identifiers, a quoted string literal or a string
	variable.


E_EQ0075_grFUTUNSUPP	"The '%0c' statement will be discontinued.\n


 Explanation:
	Refinements to the query language and forms system statements
	are made from time to time.  Functionality is always preserved
	by offering alternate statements.

 System Status:
	The preprocessor will preprocess the current statement correctly
	and will return a SUCCESS status if no other errors occur during 
	preprocessing.

 Recommendation:
	See the manual for an alternative to the statement you have used.


E_EQ0076_grNOWUNSUPP	"The '%0c' statement is not supported.\n


 Explanation:
	You have used a statement which is not supported in this release.
	The statement has either been superseded by an alternate statement
	or was never available in preprocessors in the particular host
	language.

 System Status:

	and will return a SUCCESS status if no other errors occur during 
	preprocessing.

 Recommendation:
	See the manual for the alternative syntax for this statement.


E_EQ0079_grCONNECTID	"Incorrect WITH clause containing the distributed


 Explanation:
	The 'with' clause on a connect statement is incorrectly
	specified.  When  the 'with' clause is used to pass the
	distributed transaction id to the dbms for reassociation,
	there must be no other information in the with clause.
	Distributed transaction ids must be represented as
	integer variables or values.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	See the manual for the correct syntax for this statement.


E_EQ0080_TL_STMTID    "Illegal internal statement id encountered in processing a target list."


 Explanation:
    This is an internal coding error.

    input.

 Recommendation:
    See the manual for the correct syntax for this statement.
    Correct the name of the attribute and repreprocess the file.


E_EQ0082_TL_ATTR_INVALID      "The attribute '%0c' is invalid in the scope of


 Explanation:
    The preprocessor recognizes the attribute named in the target
    list but cannot process it in the context of the current statement.
    The attribute is only legal in the the target list of some
    other statement.

 System Status:
    No code will be generated for this particular target list element
    in the current statement.  Code for the statement as a whole will be
    generated and the preprocessor will continue preprocessing the
    input.

 Recommendation:
    Check the manual for the names of the attributes allowable as
    target list elements of the current statement.  Correct the
    attribute name and repreprocess the file.


E_EQ0083_TL_TYPE_INVALID      "The type of attribute '%0c' is not compatible with the type of the program variable or value."


 Explanation:
    The type of the attribute named in the target list is not
    compatible with the type of the associated program variable or value.
    Check that the variable has been declared in a declare section.
    In general, numeric attributes must be matched with numeric variables
    or values and character attributes must be matched with character
    variables.

 System Status:
    No code will be generated for this particular target list element
    in the current statement.  Code for the statement as a whole will be
    generated and the preprocessor will continue preprocessing the
    input.

 Recommendation:
    Ensure that the variable has been declared in a declare section.
    Check the manual for the type of the attribute and supply a
    compatible user variable or value.  Repreprocess the file.


E_EQ0084_TL_ATTR_DUP  "The attribute '%0c' has already appeared in the target


 Explanation:
    In a single target list, you may specify each attribute only once.
    The attribute mentioned in the error message has been specified more
    than once in the target list in the current statement.

 System Status:
    No code will be generated for this particular target list element
    in the current statement.  Code for the statement as a whole will be
    generated and the preprocessor will continue preprocessing the
    input.

    Remove the element containing the duplicate attribute from the
    target list.  Repreprocess the file.


E_EQ0090_HDL_TYPE_INVALID "Illegal SET HANDLER value '%0c'.  Function name or 0 expected."


 Explanation:
    The attribute named in the target list of the SET_SQL statement is a
    user defined handler with a specified value of something other than
    a function name or zero.
    The only acceptable values for user defined handlers are zero, or the
    function name. 

 System Status:
    Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
    Change the value specified in the SET_SQL statement.  To "set" the 
    handler specifiy the function name, to "unset" the handler specify "0".
    Repreprocess the file.


E_EQ0091_COPYHANDLER "The COPY FROM/INTO PROGRAM statement requires the specification of a user-defined handler in the WITH clause."


 Explanation:
	Copying data from/to a program requires the name of a user-defined
	function to be specified on the COPY statement, i.e.,
	"COPY TABLE tbl () FROM PROGRAM WITH COPYHANDLER = myfunc".

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Change the COPY FROM/INTO PROGRAM statement to specify the name
	of a user-defined handler in the WITH clause.


E_EQ0125_NO_SQLDA	"The SQLDA structure is not supported in Embedded


 Explanation:
	F77 does not support data structures so in some environments
	ESQL/FORTRAN cannot support the SQLDA.

 System Status:
	Pre-processing continues. The INCLUDE SQLDA statement is ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Take the INCLUDE SQLDA statement out of the program.


E_EQ0126_sqCOMMA	"Missing comma between list elements in a WITH clause."


 Explanation:
	In a WITH clause, the different elements need to be separated by 
	commas.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Insert a comma to separate the list elements.


E_EQ0127_sqEXECMD	"Statement should begin 'EXEC %0c %1c'."


 Explanation:
	Database query and status statements should begin "EXEC SQL" 
	and forms statements should begin "EXEC FRS".

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Insert the correct statement demarker: "EXEC SQL" for database
	query and status statements and "EXEC FRS" for forms statements.


E_EQ0128_sqNOSQLCA	"No INCLUDE SQLCA statement seen so far.\n


 Explanation:
	In response to the WHENEVER statement, the preprocessor generates
	code which accesses fields in the SQLCA.  Therefore you must have
	included an SQLCA in your program module via the INCLUDE SQLCA
	statement.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Put in an INCLUDE SQLCA statement preceding the first SQL statement.


E_EQ0129_sqVARCOLON	"Variable name must be prefixed by a colon ':'.\n


 Explanation:
	All variable names used with Embedded SQL and FRS statements must
	be prefixed by a colon to indicate to the preprocessor that they
	are variables and not object names.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Prefix all variables in embedded SQL/FRS statements with a colon.


E_EQ0130_sqWCOND	"Illegal WHENEVER condition '%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	The WHENEVER statement is used to test the status of SQLCA
	variables to ascertain if the last executed SQL statement resulted
	in an error (SQLERROR), a warning (SQLWARNING) or no data matching
	the query (NOT FOUND).  In addition the SQLMESSAGE condition ascertains
	if any messages returned from the EXECUTE PROCEDURE statement,
	and the DBEVENT condition checks for database event information 
	returning from the dbms.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the WHENEVER statement to reflect the correct condition.


E_EQ0131_sqWSTOP	"Incorrect WHENEVER NOT FOUND statement.\n


 Explanation:
	The WHENEVER NOT FOUND is commonly used to break out of a
	CURSOR FETCH loop.  This is not a useful place to stop execution
	of a program.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Change the specified action to CONTINUE, GOTO a label or CALL
	a procedure.


E_EQ0132_sqILLSTRUCTEXPR	"Illegal use of record variable.\n


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when a record variable is used as part of an 
	expression, ie, "1 + :record_var".  Record variables may be used 
	in the INSERT, SELECT and FETCH statements but they must be used alone.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Use an elementary variable in the expression.


E_EQ0133_sqNOFROM	 "The SELECT statement requires a FROM clause.\n


 Explanation:
	In order for a WHERE or any of the other above clauses to qualify
	the results of a query, a table name must be specified in a FROM clause.
	The FROM clause is optional if you only SELECT constants.
	
 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Insert a FROM clause into the current query.


E_EQ0134_sqNAME	"Name or string variable expected instead of '%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	A numeric variable has been used where a string variable or a
	simple name was expected. 
	
 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Change the statement to use a string variable (preceded by a colon)
	or a simple name (with no colon).


E_EQ0135_sqXACT	"SQL transaction syntax '%0c' has been modified.\n


 Explanation:
	The SQL version 5.0 syntax was used (BEGIN TRANSACTION, END
	TRANSACTION, ABORT).  The BEGIN TRANSACTION will generate a run-time
	error too, as an SQL program is implicitly inside a transaction.
	The END TRANSACTION should be replaced by COMMIT, and the ABORT by
	ROLLBACK.  This warning can be ignored if you intend to use the
	SET AUTOCOMMIT option at run-time, implying that BEGIN TRANSACTION
	is necessary.
	
 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Change the statement to use the SQL transaction syntax.


E_EQ0151_fsBAD	"Unknown identifier '%0c' in SET/INQUIRE statement.\n


 Explanation:
	You have used an object-type or constant that is unknown to the
	preprocessor in an INQUIRE_FRS or SET_FRS statement.  You may not
	use a variable name to specify the object you wish to inquire about
	or set.

 Explanation:
	Specific object names and values, such as MENU1, FRSKEY3 and PF5
	have numbers associated with them (ie, 1, 3 and 5).  The numbers
	must be within the specified range, as that is the range of 
	run-time support.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Refer to the manual for the legal range of numbers that
	qualify object names.


E_EQ0160_fsPFCTRL	"PF key number or control key character expected\n.


 Explanation:
	Some FRS statements allow the assignment of a control key
	(ie, controlF) or a function key (ie, PF2).  You may not use
	a variable to represent this assignment, or use a control key 
	character or function key number which is out of range.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Specify a legal control key or function key in the current statement.


E_EQ0201_scBADINCEXT	"Illegal or missing suffix on INCLUDE file '%0c'.\n

	immediately follows the dereference character.


E_EQ0204_scEOFCMT	"Premature End Of File found in comment."


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor unexpectedly encountered the end of the input
	file when scanning an embedded comment.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Close the comment before the end of file.


E_EQ0205_scEOFMIDLINE	"End of file found in middle of line.\n


 Explanation:
	This error may occur if you run the preprocessor interactively

 Explanation:
	Output files cannot be opened because a user does not have write
	privileges.  There may be other system dependent reasons.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Attempt to open a file with the same name at the system level and take
	note of the system response.


E_EQ0211_scINCQUOTE	"Illegal INCLUDE file name delimiter character '%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when a delimiter other than a single or double
	quote is used.  Note that embedded languages in C may also use
	the '<' and '>' delimiters.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Replace the delimiters with the correct ones or omit delimiters
	altogether.


E_EQ0212_scLINLONG	"Input line exceeds maximum line length, %0c.\n


 Explanation:
	This error occurs on very long input lines.  Note that the 
	line length acceptable to the preprocessor is the same as that
	acceptable to many compilers.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Break up the flagged line into smaller lines.  If the line contains
	a SQL statement, use host language line continuation.  EQUEL
	statements require no special line continuation.



E_EQ0213_scHEXLONG	"Maximum hex or Unicode constant length, %0c, is exceeded by <%1c>."


 Explanation:
	The constant used contains too many characters.  Note that the
	maximum number of characters allowed is extremely large and users
	are unlikely to come up against this limit.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Substitute a smaller constant, or use an expression comprised
	of smaller constants.


E_EQ0214_scNUMLONG	"Maximum number length, %0c, is exceeded by '%1c'."


 Explanation:
	The decimal number used contains too many digits.  Note that the
	maximum number of digits allowed is extremely large and users
	are unlikely to come up against this limit.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Substitute a smaller numeric constant, or use an expression comprised
	of smaller constants.


E_EQ0215_scSTRLONG	"Maximum string length, %0c, is exceeded by <%1c...>."


 Explanation:
	The string literal used contains too many characters.  Note that
	the maximum string length allowed is as big as that allowed by
	most compilers.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	If the host language allows string continuation, try to split the 
	string over two lines.


E_EQ0216_scWRDLONG	"Maximum word length, %0c, is exceeded by '%1c'."


 Explanation:
	The word used contains too many characters.  Note that the
	maximum number of characters allowed in an word is extremely 
	large and users are unlikely to come up against this limit.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Reduce the size of the name.


E_EQ0217_scIDLONG	"Maximum identifier length, %0c, is exceeded by '%1c%2c'."


 Explanation:
	The variable name or object name used is too long.  A variable name
	in this context includes a fully qualified record variable or a 
	subscripted variable.  An object name includes, for example, a
	column name along with a correlation or range variable.  The
	maximum identifier length is extremely large and users are
	unlikely to come up against this limit.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Use a shorter variable or object name.


E_EQ0218_scMISSRIGHT	"Missing delimiter(s) <%0c> (from line %1c).\n


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor was scanning input looking for a terminating 
	or delimiting character (ie, a closing parenthesis or bracket
	or a closing quotation mark) when it encountered an End of File. 
	This is probably a syntax error.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Check the flagged line for a syntax error or missing delimiter.	


E_EQ0219_scNLSTR	"New-line in string <%0c>.\n


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when the user types a new-line in a quoted string
	without using any form of line continuation.  If the host language
	permits string continuation, the QUEL convention for continuation
	is a back-slash, "\" on the line to be continued with the string
	continuing in the leftmost column of the next line.  The SQL
	convention for continuation follows the host language rules for
	string continuation.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Continue string using appropriate query language convention
	if the host language allows string continuation.


E_EQ0220_scNUMCONV	"Conversion of '%0c' to integer/float failed.\n


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when a very large numeric constant cannot be
	converted into an internal numeric format.  The preprocessor and the
	run-time code use standard numeric storage.  Very large numbers, for
	instance floating point numbers requiring 16-byte storage, will
	cause an error from the preprocessor and from the run-time code.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Reduce the size of the numeric constant.


E_EQ0221_scOPERATOR	"Unknown operator '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when an operator used in an embedded statement 
	is not recognized by the preprocessor.  The query languages recognize 
	specific operators for comparisons, assignments and pattern
	matching. 

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the operator from the embedded statement.


E_EQ0222_scSCCMNT	"Unknown Comment start '%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor recognizes embedded comment lines using the
	host language comment indicator.  For all host languages the
	preprocessor recognizes the embedded comment delimiters.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Use the conventional host language comment delimiters or the
	generic embedded comment delimiters.


E_EQ0223_scINCMANY	"Too many directories for included files.\n


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when the preprocessor command line specifies
	with the -h flag too many directories to be searched for include files.

 System Status:
	The preprocessor will exit without preprocessing the input file.

 Recommendation:
	Consolidate the files to be included into fewer directories.


E_EQ0224_scINCBADDIR	"Invalid directory '%0c' for included files."


 Explanation:
	The directory specified with the -h command line flag is not
	a valid directory name on this system.  The user may have typed
	the complete path name incorrectly.

 System Status:
	The preprocessor will exit without preprocessing the user's input.

 Recommendation:
	Invoke the preprocessor again using a valid path and directory name.


E_EQ0225_scINCNULDIR	"Empty directory name specified for included files."


 Explanation:
	A null directory has been specified with the -h flag on the
	preprocessor command line.

 System Status:
	The preprocessor will exit without preprocessing the user's input.

 Recommendation:
	Follow the -h flag with the name of a directory in which files
	to be included can be found.


E_EQ0226_scINCNOTFOUND	"Cannot find INCLUDE input file '%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	This errors occurs when the INCLUDE statement is attempting to
	include a file from one of the directories specified with the
	'-h' flag on the command line, and that file does not exist in
	any of the specified directories.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Either correct the directory named with the -h flag, or correct
	the file name used in the INCLUDE statement.


E_EQ0227_scHEXCHAR	"Illegal character '%0c' found in hex constant."


 Explanation:
	A hex constant (ie, X'1FFF') can contain digits and the alphabetic
	characters A through F only.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the syntax of the flagged hex constant.


E_EQ0228_scHEXODD	"Odd number of characters in hex constant '%0c'.


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor expects the first character/digit of a
	hex constant to map to a high order byte boundary.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	If your hex constant contains an odd number of characters, include a
	leading zero.  For example, X'1FF' becomes X'01FF'.


E_EQ0229_scBADQUOTE	"The correct delimiter for literal strings is <%1c>.\n


 Explanation:
	Literal strings in Embedded SQL statements must be delimited by
	the single quote <'>.  Embedded host declarations follow the rules
	of the host language for quoted strings.  The manual contains examples
	of quoted strings in both embedded statements and embedded host 
	declarations; it also instructs on how to include a quotation within 
	an embedded string.  This message is only a warning, so as to be
	compatible with earlier versions of Embedded SQL.

 System Status:
	This message is just a warning.

 Recommendation:
	Change the string delimiter in the current statement to the legal
	Embedded SQL string delimiter.


E_EQ0230_scEMBEDQUOTE	"Illegal embedding of quote in a SQL string.\n


 Explanation:
	Some host language compilers do not allow the outer string
	delimiter to appear inside a string.  In Embedded SQL, the
	SQL delimiter can always appear inside the string by doubling it.
	However, in some languages the preprocessor does not allow a non-SQL
	string delimiter to appear within an SQL string.  Note that because
	the preprocessor stops processing the string upon encountering
	the illegal delimiter, the remainder of the string is likely to
	produce a syntax error.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Use the doubled SQL delimiter if you wish to place a string delimiter
	inside a string.


E_EQ0231_scMISSEND	"No matching END for BEGIN on line %0c.\n


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor was scanning a BEGIN/END block, looking for the 
	END, when it encountered an End of File. This is probably a 
	syntax error.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Check for a misspelled END, or for a BEGIN without a matching END.


E_EQ0232_scUESC		"Invalid escape sequence in Unicode literal."


 Explanation:
	Escape sequences in Unicode literals must follow the convention
	\hhhh where hhhh are the 4 hex digits of the code point to be 
	inserted, or \+hhhhhh where hhhhhh are the 6 hex digits of the 
	4 byte code point to be inserted (the high order byte is always
	set to 0). A \ followed by anything other than the notations 
	described above, or by a newline or a second \ (meaning the 
	actual '\' character is being coded) will result in this error.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the escape sequence.


E_EQ0233_scILIT	"Invalid format for interval literal."


 Explanation:
	An interval literal is of the format "INTERVAL'nnnnn' <interval type>"
	where <interval type> is of the format <field1> TO <field2>. This
	literal did not satisfy the required format of <interval type>.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the interval literal.


E_EQ0240_yyOVFL	"Internal error: Parser stack overflow."


 Explanation:
	An internal data structure is not big enough to allow the
	preprocessor to complete the current statement.  This may indicate
	an internal coding error or an embedded statement that is too complex.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Try to restructure your statement so that it is syntactically
	simpler.


E_EQ0241_yySYNTAX	"Syntax error."


 Explanation:
	A syntax error has occurred on the current statement.  Usually
	the rest of the statement is ignored.  However, some syntax errors
	will confuse the preprocessor's syntactic recovery causing more
	errors in subsequent statements.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement causing the syntax error.


E_EQ0242_yySYNHOST	"Syntax error on host code."


 Explanation:
	This error occurs when host code appears in the middle of an
	embedded statement.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Complete the embedded statement that appears before the flagged
	host code line.


E_EQ0243_yySYNTERM	"Syntax error on terminator or missing %0c continuation indicator."


 Explanation:
	For those host languages that do not have SQL statement terminators, 
	the preprocessor allows the ';' terminator on most embedded statements.
	(This proves useful when using the preprocessor interactively.)
	However, a terminator is prohibited on declarations and some
	statements and will produce the above error.  This error is also
	caused when an embedded SQL statement is continued over more than
	one line and the host continuation indicator (if any) is omitted.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the statement terminator or supply the host language
	continuation indicator.


E_EQ0244_yySYNWRD	"Syntax error on '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor has identified the word or symbol which is 
	syntactically incorrect.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the syntax.


E_EQ0245_yySYNEOF	"Syntax error on End-of-File."


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor has unexpectedly encountered an End of File.  This
	error usually occurs if the end of file occurred in the middle of
	a block-type embedded statement or an SQL declaration section.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Complete the embedded block or statement.


E_EQ0251_syBADLEVEL	"Invalid record level %0c in declaration for '%1c'."


 Explanation:
	If record levels are required when declaring variables (ie, as in
	PL/I or COBOL), they must be ordered correctly according
	to the rules of the host language.

 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0252_syCHEKNULL	" Symbol table: Null pointer to check_type_loop."


 Explanation:
	If you have defined a type and are referencing a variable of that type,
	try to make the variable a base type.  This may reduce the complexity
	of the variable look-up.  This is an internal error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0253_syDEEPIMPORT	"Symbol table IMPORT of '%0c' is too deep."


 Explanation:
	If your host language allows the IMPORT of variables from an outer
	scope, you cannot import deeper than 20 levels.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0254_syEXPORTVIS	"Illegal attempt to EXPORT already visible name '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	If your host language allows the EXPORT of variables to an outer
	scope, you must confirm that the variable has not been declared
	in the outer scope.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0255_syFSTAKOFLO	"Symbol table record field stack overflow - fields discarded."


 Explanation:
	If you have qualified a structure variable, it should have less than
	20 member names qualifying it.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0256_syLOOKANON	"Symbol table lookup of an anonymous entry."


 Explanation:
	In a language in which you do not have to name a structure type (such
	as C), the preprocessor is trying to reference the type name.  Try
	naming all your structure types (ie, use structure tags or type
	declarations).  This is an internal error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0257_syMODIFY	"Symbol table modify of '%0c' is neither imported nor exported."


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor is confused about what it thinks is either an IMPORT
	or EXPORT statement.  If you have any try changing them to explicit
	declarations in their relevant scopes.  This is an internal error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0258_syNOTVISIBL	"'%0c' is not visible for IMPORT statement."


 Explanation:
	If your language allows IMPORT from an outer scope, then the name
	of the variable must be visible in the parent scope.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0259_syQNOTSUCC	"Symbol table q_remove: q_elm not successor of q_before."


 Explanation:
	The symbol table data structures have been damaged.  Try to use fewer
	type and variable declarations.  You may have to split your file into
	two smaller files.  This is an internal error.
	
 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0260_syREDECLARE	"Redeclaration of identifier '%0c' is ignored."


 Explanation:
	The named identifier as been redeclared.  The preprocessors stores
	all declaration objects in a single name space, consequently, type
	names, constant names and variable names must be different.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0261_syREIMPORT	"Attempt to IMPORT already visible name '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	If your language allows IMPORT from an outer scope, then the imported
	name must not be an already-declared object in the nested scope.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0262_sySSTKOFLO	"Symbol table scope stack overflow - nesting limit is %0c."


 Explanation:
	Rearrange the nesting of embedded blocks so that they are not so nested.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0263_sySSTKUFLO	"Symbol table scope stack underflow."


 Explanation:
	If there were syntax error while preprocessing the current statement
	then correct the errors and try again.  Also try to rearrange the
	nesting of embedded blocks.  This is an internal error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0264_sySVISZERO	"Symbol table scope end: found '%0c' with visibility of zero."


 Explanation:
	The symbol table data structures have been damaged.  Try reducing the
	number of declarations in the module.  This is an internal error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0265_syTYPLOOP	"Symbol table type loop for ('%0c', '%1c')."


 Explanation:
	You have defined a type recursively causing confusion in the symbol
	table data structures.  This is an internal error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0266_syUNDECSTAT	"'%0c' is undeclared in IMPORT/EXPORT statement."


 Explanation:
	You have tried to IMPORT or EXPORT a name that was never declared.
	All names must be declared before you can expand their scope.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0267_sySQREDEC	"Redeclaration of identifier '%0c' with incompatible type."


 Explanation:
	Embedded SQL allows the redeclarations of some variables.  The variables
	must be elementary variables (not structures or types).  Any
	redeclaration requires an exact type match.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0268_syTYPEUNDEF	"'%0c' references '%1c', which is not yet defined."


 Explanation:
	If your host language allows forward declarations (ADA, BASIC, PASCAL)
	your must make sure that you have declared the forward-defined type
	before using a variable of that type.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0301_actBAD	"Illegal ACTIVATE type, %0c, passed."


 Explanation:
	The preprocessor does not recognize the ACTIVATE type used.
	This may be an internal error.  If you have complex ACTIVATE 
	block control flow, try to flatten out any nested blocks and 
	reduce the number of RESUME statements.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0302_actCOL	"Missing ACTIVATE COLUMN name - table is '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	This is a syntax error in an ACTIVATE COLUMN statement that was caught
	too late.  Add the column name to the ACTIVATE statement.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0303_actNEST	"ACTIVATE blocks are nested too deeply - limit is %0c."


 Explanation:
	Rearrange the nesting of DISPLAY and ACTIVATE blocks so that there
	are fewer levels of nesting.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0304_actNULL	"Null ACTIVATE object passed - type is %0c."


 Explanation:
	If you used a variable name for an ACTIVATE object try to replace it
	with a string literal.  This is an internal error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0305_actUNDFL	"ACTIVATE block underflow."


 Explanation:
	If there were syntax errors while processing DISPLAY and ACTIVATE
	blocks but not within the code enclosed in the block, correct the
	errors.  If there were no syntax errors then this is an internal
	coding error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0306_actARGS	"Illegal ACTIVATE target list syntax (%0c = %1c)."


 Explanation:
	The target lists allowed with various ACTIVATE conditions must be
	of the format:
		(object = value {, object = value})
	with the correct type and range for the value.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0307_actRESNEXT	"Cannot RESUME NEXT in an ACTIVATE %0c block."


 Explanation:
	RESUME NEXT should be used to resume from an ACTIVATE FIELD or an
	ACTIVATE COLUMN.  RESUME NEXT within other ACTIVATE blocks may
	generate this warning.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0308_actTIMEOUT	"Only one ACTIVATE TIMEOUT block is allowed in a display loop."


 Explanation:
	There may be only one activate block to handle timeout in a
	display loop.  Only the first ACTIVATE TIMEOUT block will be
	used at run-time.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0309_actTARGET	"An ACTIVATE %0c block may not have a target list."


 Explanation:
	The optional target list may not be used on all ACTIVATE
	statements.  Consult the embedded language User's Guide for
	the list of ACTIVATE statements which allow a target list.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0310_actBADRES	"Cannot RESUME %0c in an ACTIVATE %1c block."


 Explanation:
	Only a "plain" RESUME can be used in an ACTIVATE DBEVENT block.
	RESUME NEXT, RESUME FIELD, RESUME COLUMN, RESUME MENU, RESUME
	ENTRY are not allowed.

 System Status:
	Preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

 Recommendation:
	Change user code to use the RESUME statement.


E_EQ0311_actONLYEVENT	"ACTIVATE DBEVENT cannot be the only ACTIVATE block in a DISPLAY loop."


 Explanation:
	An ACTIVATE DBEVENT by itself in a DISPLAY loop will simply not work.
	The DBEVENT block is dependent on other activations to "trigger"
	the FRS to do the "get dbevent"; otherwise, the DBEVENT block will 
	never be called.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:
	Add other activations to the display loop.


E_EQ0316_argMAX	"Statement has too many arguments.  The limit is %0c arguments."


 Explanation:
	Reduce the number of arguments to the statement.  This is probably the
	SQL CONNECT statement or QUEL INGRES statement, as most other statements
	have a fixed number of arguments.  The specified limit may include
	internally generated arguments.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0317_argNOARGS	"There are %0c argument(s), statement requires more."


 Explanation:
	There was probably a syntax error in the current statement, and the
	preprocessor error recovery routine did not supply enough dummy
	arguments for code generation.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0326_lblOVERFLOW	"Too many nested blocks, maximum is %0c."


 Explanation:
	Rearrange the nesting of embedded blocks (DISPLAY, ACTIVATE,
	UNLOADTABLE, etc) so that they are not so deeply nested.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0327_lblUNDERFLOW	"Label block manager underflow."


 Explanation:
	If there were syntax errors while processing embedded blocks
	(DISPLAY, ACTIVATE, UNLOADTABLE, etc) but not within the code enclosed
	in the block, then correct the errors.  If there were no syntax
	errors then this is an internal coding error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0328_lblUNKNOWNMOD	"Unknown label mode - %0c."


 Explanation:
	This is an internal error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0336_outFUNC	"Null function pointer passed for Output state trap."


 Explanation:
	If you are declaring many cursors together with using repeated 
	queries, try rearranging their order.  If there were syntax errors
	during the cursor declarations and repeated queries then correct the
	syntax errors.  If there were no syntax errors then this is an
	internal coding error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0341_strBADPTR	"String Table pointer is out of bounds."


 Explanation:
	This is an internal coding error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0342_strSIZE	"Illegal String Table size initializer, %0c."


 Explanation:
	This is an internal coding error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0343_strSPACE	"Not enough String Table space for %0c bytes."


 Explanation:
	If this occurs after an error indicating that an object has exceeded
	its maximum size (such as a string literal that is too long), then
	correct the previous error.  Otherwise this is an internal coding
	error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0344_strTRUNC	"String '%0c' too large for String Table buffer (%1c bytes)."


 Explanation:
	If the specified string refers to objects in the preprocessed file,
	then try to break up the object names into smaller pieces
	(ie, replacing large string literals with variables).  If the
	specified string does not include objects from the file, then this is
	an internal coding error.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0376_repARG	"Use REPEAT queries for compiling parameters with '@'."


 Explanation:
	In order to use the '@' operator with variables replacing QUEL
	constants, you must prefix the query with the word "REPEAT".

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0377_repNOTIMP	"REPEAT queries are not implemented with this version."


 Explanation:
	Some versions of the preprocessor do not support REPEAT queries.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0378_repWHERE	"A variable may not substitute for a complete WHERE clause in a REPEATED statement."


 Explanation:
	You may not use a host variable to substitute for a WHERE clause in
	a REPEATED statement.  The dbms saves the query execution plan
	of a REPEATED query using the initial values specified in the
	WHERE clause.  This means that the dbms will not automatically apply
	any change to the WHERE clause on repeated execution of the query.
	This rule applies to changes to the WHERE clause while the application
	is running and changes resulting from more than one user running the
	same application and supplying different WHERE clause values.  Note
	that this rule does not apply to substituting a variable for a single
	value or expression in a WHERE clause.  Changes to these variables
	are applied by the dbms to repeated query executions.
	
 System Status:
	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.  The
	error will not prevent the application from compiling, but it will
	produce a run-time error.

 Recommendation:
	Either remove the 'REPEATED' word from the statement or reconstruct
	the WHERE clause to substitute variables for individual expressions.
	Repreprocess the module.


E_EQ0386_retVAR	"Result column, '%0c', for data retrieval must be a variable."


 Explanation:
	The result variable used in an SQL SELECT or QUEL RETRIEVE statement
	to collect the data must have been properly declared to the
	preprocessor.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0396_csBADTYPE	"Retrieval of cursor '%0c' into '%1c' conflicts with earlier retrieval."


 Explanation:
	The base type (numeric or string type) of a result variable in
	an SQL FETCH or QUEL RETRIEVE CURSOR statement conflicts with the type
	of the same column on a preceding retrieval in the same file.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0397_csDECNULL	"Declaration of a cursor without a name."


 Explanation:
	You have declared an empty string literal as a cursor name.  String
	literals can be used to declare cursors whose names are reserved words,
	but they must not be null strings.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0398_csNOCSR	"Cursor named '%0c' is not yet declared."


 Explanation:
	You have issued a cursor statement (such as a retrieval) without
	a preceding cursor declaration (DECLARE CURSOR) or the named cursor.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0399_csNOCURCSR	"No cursor referenced in current statement."


 Explanation:
	If you used an empty string to declare a cursor then correct the
	previous error.  Otherwise the preprocessor has not retained the
	current cursor name within a cursor statement, and then this
	is an internal coding error.

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0400_csNOTUPD	"%0c of read-only cursor '%1c' is not legal."


 Explanation:
	The specified cursor is can not be updated (ie, it may refer
	to a join of multiple tables).  The update operation specified in
	the first argument (such as DELETE) is not allowed.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0401_csOBJNULL	"In cursor '%0c', object name is empty."


 Explanation:
	An empty string literal has been given as an object name in a cursor
	declaration (other than for a cursor name).  This may be a table or
	a column name.  Correct the object to correctly specify the name.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0402_csREDECCSR	"Redeclaration of cursor '%0c'."


 Explanation:
	The named cursor has already been declared.  The scope of a cursor
	declaration is the whole source file.  The same cursor name cannot
	be redeclared to the preprocessor.  This does not affect the executable
	OPEN statement, which can occur multiple times. 

 System Status:

 Explanation:
	The table name referenced in the cursor DELETE or UPDATE
	statement is not the same as the table name specified in the
	DECLARE CURSOR statement.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0428_csCURSORNAME	"Reference to cursor '%0c' is incompatible with declaration."


 Explanation:
	If a DECLARE CURSOR statement uses a variable to represent the
	cursor name, all references to that cursor must also use the
	same variable name.  Similarly, if a DECLARE CURSOR statement
	uses a static name, subsequent cursor operations must also
	use the same static name.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_EQ0429_csBADFROM	"The cursor '%0c' statement may not contain a FROM clause."


 Explanation:
	The optional FROM clause cannot be used in a cursor update statement;

	The "-m" flag (which specifies `macro' or assembler output) is supported
	in the VAX/VMS environment only.  Compiled forms are always created as
	C language structures in all environments other than VAX/VMS.

 System Status:
	The program will ignore the "-m" flag.

 Recommendation:
	Do not use the "-m" flag in subsequent calls to "compform".

 Explanation:
	The Form Index file failed to read in a form correctly from the Forms
	Index file.  This is an internal programming problem.

 System Status:
	The program will abort.

 Recommendation:
	Report this internal problem to your technical support representative.


E_FD0005_FormLoadErr	"Error loading form '%0c' from index file.\n


 Explanation:
	An error was detected when trying to load the named form read from the
	Form Index file.  Internal checks are made to see if the data structure
	is internally consistent, and one of them failed.  This usually is
	because the data for the form was either corrupted or incomplete when
	it was either written to or read from the Form Index file.  This shows
	that the installation of the Forms Index file is incorrect.

 System Status:
	The program will abort.

 Recommendation:
	Check with your INGRES system administrator to determine if the
	installation is correct.  If the installation is correct, report
	this problem to your technical support representative.

E_FD0028_internal_fmt_error


 Explanation:
	An internal error has occurred.  Attempts to perform basic
	fmt routines on the current/new format (for dynamically
	changing formats) have returned bad status despite other
	routines having determined that all is OK.

 System Status:

	The forms system has rejected the value for the field.
	Processing will continue after user has cleared the error
	message.

  Recommendation:
	Correct value in the field.


E_FI2199_8601


  Explanation:
	You have entered a value that did not pass the validation
	check that exists for the field.  You must correct
	value for the field.  This is essentially the
	same as error 8600 except that we print out user's error
	message first.

  System Status:
	The forms system has rejected the value for the field.
	Processing will continue after user has cleared the error
	message.

  Recommendation:
	Correct value in the field.


E_FI21CA_8650


  Explanation:
	The field is a mandatory field.  This means that the
	field may not be left entirely blank and that the NULL value
	is also invalid for the field.  The user needs to enter
	a non-NULL and non-blank value into the field.

  System Status:
	The forms system has rejected the blanks or NULL value in
	the current field.

  Recommendation:
	Please enter a non-NULL or non-blank value into the
	field.


E_FI21CB_8651


  Explanation:
	The forms system has encountered invalid characters that have
	been entered into the field.  Alternatively, the number
	entered is too large for the associated integer type.
	Since the field
	is an integer field, the types of characters that may
	be entered is limited to the digits 0 through 9 and a leading
	"-" or "+" character.

  System Status:
	The forms system has rejected what has been entered into the
	field.  User needs to correct the data in the field.

	Remove any alphabetic and punctuation characters that are
	in the field.


E_FI21CC_8652


  Explanation:
	The forms system has encountered invalid characters that have
	been entered into the field.  Alternatively, the number
	entered is too large for the associated floating point type.
	Since the field
	is a floating point field, the types of characters that may
	be entered is limited to the digits 0 through 9, the decimal
	point, the comma, the "-" and "+" sign and the exponential
	"e" (if the format for the current field is the exponential "e"
	format).

  System Status:
	The forms system has rejected what has been entered into the
	field.  User needs to correct the data in the field.

  Recommendation:
	Please check what has been entered into the field.
	Remove any alphabetic and punctuation characters that are
	in the field.  A floating point number may be entered
	and displayed in many ways, please consult the VIFRED and
	REPORT WRITER manuals for the various possible formats.


E_FI21CD_8653


  Explanation:
	The data entered into the field could not be converted
	into an internal value.  Reasons may be invalid characters
	entered into the field, but more probably is that the data
	does not conform to the format for the field.  The
	latter is a possibility if the field has numeric or date
	templates as the format specification.

  System Status:
	The forms system has rejected what has been entered into the
	field.  User needs to correct the data in the field.

  Recommendation:
	Please check and correct any typos in the field.  Common errors are
	transpositions of characters, entering punctuation where they
	are not allowed and entering data that does not conform to
	the format for the field.  The user may see the format for
	the field by selecting the "ListChoices" menuitem,
	if that facility is available.


E_FI21CE_8654


  Explanation:
	The field holds either an integer or floating point
	number.  The user has entered a value that is too large
	for the field.  Please note that a one byte integer may
	only hold values from -128 to +127, a two byte integer may
	only hold values form -32,768 to +32,767 and a four byte
	integer may only hold values from -2,147,483,648 to
	+2,147,483,647.  For a four byte integer, the approximate
	range of values is (+ or -) 0.29 X 10**-38 to 1.7 X 10**38 with
	7 digits of precision.  For an eight byte integer, the
	approximate range of values is (+ or 1) 0.56 X 10**-308 to
	0.9 X 10**308 with 15 digits of precision.  The data entered
	into the field exceeded these limits.

  System Status:
	The forms system has rejected the data in the field and
	will continue with processing.

  Recommendation:
	Please enter a smaller number into the numeric field.


E_FI21CF_8655


  Explanation:
	The field holds a floating point number.  The user has
	entered a value that is too small for the field.  Please remember
	that a four byte floating point number only has 7 digits of
	precision and an eight byte floating point number only has
	15 digits of precision.  The data in the field has specified
	a precision greater than the specified datatype for the field.

  System Status:
	The forms system has rejected the data in the field and
	will continue with processing.

  Recommendation:
	Please enter a larger number into the floating point field.


E_FI21D0_8656


  Explanation:
	The default value for the specified field could not all
	fit into the field.  The value was truncated.

  System Status:
	The forms system will continue processing.

  Recommendation:
	End user should notify the support person for the application
	they are using.  An application builder should check to length
	of a field to make sure that the default value can fit.

  User action:
	Fix any such data before again attempting to set the mode to 'read'.


E_FI226E_8814_ClrMandFld


  Explanation:
	The field is a mandatory field.  This means that the
	field may not be left entirely blank and that the NULL value
	is also invalid for the field.  The user cannot clear the field.

  System Status:
	The forms system has rejected the blanks in the field.

  Recommendation:
	Please enter a non-NULL or non-blank value into the field.


E_FI226F_8815_BAD_PUTROW_STATE


  Explanation:
	The application requested an unsupported change in _STATE using
	a putrow statement.  The allowed changes are:  if the current
	value of _STATE is NEW, then the new value may be NEW,
	UNCHANGED or CHANGED; if the current value is UNCHANGED or
	CHANGED then the new value may be UNCHANGED or CHANGED.
	No other transitions are currently supported.

  System Status:
	The forms system will not change the _STATE value in the
	table field.  Execution continues with the next statement.

  Recommendation:
	Application writer needs to modify code to follow the rules
	stated above.

 Parameters:

 Explanation:
      This error occurs on the rare chance that the application source
      code directory is missing from the intermediate file. If manually
      altered, the intermediate file might have been corrupted, thus 
      preventing IIIMPORT from reading it properly.

 System Status:
      Program exits. No source files are copied, but changes to the
      database are accepted.

 Recommendation:
      Examine intermediate file; re-run IIEXPORT to re-generate the file.


E_IE0008_Dir_not_exist "Directory `%0c' does not exist\n.


 Parameters:
      %0      Directory name specified in intermediate file.

 Explanation:
      This error occurs if the directory, as specified in the
      intermediate file, does not appear to exist on the target machine.
      If the desired source files are located on another machine, they
      will have to be copied over manually.
 
 System Status:
      Program exits. No source files are copied, but changes to the
      database are accepted.

 Recommendation:
      Source files must be manually copied.

 Parameters:
      %0      Name of the file IIIMPORT is attempting to open

 Explanation:
      This error occurs when IIIMPORT tries to copy source files. The
      error occurs when trying to read a source file from the directory 
      specified in the intermediate file. IIIMPORT must be able to read 
      the file in order to copy it. Make sure you have permission to 
      read files in the old application's source code directory.
 
 System Status:
      Program exits. No source files are copied, but changes to the
      database are accepted.

 Recommendation:
      Source files must be manually copied if permissions are
      not addressed.

      %1      Type of file: "listing", "temporary", or "intermediate".
      %2      Which program issues the message (IIIMPORT or IIEXPORT).

 Explanation:
      This error occurs in IIMPORT when either creating the listing file, 
      or when copying source files. If the file name is "iiIEsrcX.tmp",
      it means IIIMPORT could not open a file in the existing
      application's source code directory in preparation for copying
      source files. 
      
      This error occurs in IIEXPORT when creating the intermediate file. 
      Make sure that you have permission to write in this directory.
 
 System Status:
      Program exits. For IIIMPORT, no source files are copied, but 
      changes to the database are accepted. For IIEXPORT, processing stops. 

 Recommendation:
      For IIIMPORT, source files must be manually copied if write 
      permissions are not addressed. IIEXPORT users must assure they
      have write permissions in the target directory.

      %0      Name of the application in question
      %1      Error number returned by the internal module

 Explanation:
      There was an error retrieving the objects for an application.
      This could indicate an internal problem in IIEXPORT, but could
      also exist because of problems in the database.

 System Status:
      Program issues an error message, and exits.

 Recommendation:
      Make sure the application name is correct.  Try running
      ABF on the application.  Finally, report the error to

      %1      Name of the object whose long remarks we couldn't read

 Explanation:
      This error occurs when the long remarks cannot be retrieved out
      of the system catalogs for the given object. This indicates that 
      the system catalogs have been altered manually (or have in other ways
      been corrupted). 
 
 System Status:
      Program issues an error message, and exits.

 Recommendation:
      Contact your Site Technical Contact. Try running ABF on the

 Parameters:
      %0      Name of the application object
      %1      Class Id of the object.

 Explanation:
      There is an internal error in IIEXPORT so that it can not
      copy out an object. Generally, an output function is class
      specific, which is why the (usually internal) Class ID of the 
      object is printed.

 System Status:
      IIEXPORT will simply ignore this object and continue to
      write the output file.

 Recommendation:
      Report this to your Site Technical Contact; the class id and
      object name will be important to note.


E_IE0017_No_Class_Thing "Could not copy %1c `%0c' to the file"

      an internal error, otherwise known as an "impossible condition" 
      check. It occurred in the section of code which processed the
      -allflags. It should be reported to the Site Technical Contact.
 
 System Status:
      Processing continues after the message. The current object will
      not be included by the -all<flag> mechanism (e.g., if it is a frame, 
      and -allframes was issued, this frame will be skipped).

 Recommendation:
      Report this to your Site Technical Contact.


E_IE001A_Memory_Alloc_Err "INTERNAL ERROR: Memory allocation.

 Parameters:
      None

 Explanation:
      An internal check discovered that the third line in the file, 
      immediate following the OC_APPL: line, is corrupt. This usually means
      the file has been altered.

 System Status:
      Processing Stops; the program exits.

 Recommendation:
      Re-run iiexport to re-generate the file. 


E_IE0020_Cannot_Read_File "Can't open file `%0c' for reading.\n"

      %0      Name of the file

 Explanation:
      IIIMPORT has discovered, while attempting to copy in, that the first
      line of the intermediate file has a bad format.

 System Status:
      Processing Stops; the program exits.

 Recommendation:
      Check the intermediate file to see whether it really is an 
      intermediate file, and, if necessary, run IIEXPORT again to
      create a new one. Assure that the file has not been manually 
      edited.


E_IE0022_Not_Compatible "Incompatible file version.\n


 Parameters:
      %0      Name of the file

 Explanation:
      The version of the file is from a release later than that of the 
      IIIMPORT utility being used to import it into the database.  
      Since the file contains data for features not yet supported by 
      this release that includes this IIIMPORT utility, it cannot be 
      copied into the database.

 System Status:
      IIIMPORT will terminate without importing the objects in the file.

 Recommendation:
      Your system administrator must upgrade your INGRES release to the
      version compatible with the system from which the file was copied.
      Please contact your INGRES system administrator.


E_IE0023_Out_Of_Order   "IIIMPORT expected to read the first line of the next


 Parameters:
      None

 Explanation:
      IIIMPORT uses a state machine to read in the file. At this point, it
      expects the beginning of a new object definition (a line beginning with
      "OC_XXX:", where XXX indicates which object it is). Instead, it found
      a line beginning with a tab or CUC_XXX. This indicates that the file
      has been hand edited. 
 
 System Status:
      Processing Stops. No changes will be made to the database.

 Recommendation:
      Regenerate the file; contact your Site Technical Contact if it
      persists.

      either indicates an internal error, or that the file was manually 
      edited.
 
 System Status:
      Processing Stops. No changes are made.

 Recommendation:
      Re-generate the file via IIEXPORT. Notify the Site Technical Contact
      if the problem persists.

      %1      Internal object code returned.

 Explanation:
      This error occurs when IIIMPORT expect to be reading a data line.
      These lines begin with a tab. The first token read in was not a tab,
      triggering this error. Make sure the file has not been manually
      edited.
 
 System Status:
      Processing Stops. No changes are made.

 Recommendation:
      Re-generate the file via IIEXPORT. Notify the Site Technical Contact

 Parameters:
      %0      flag name (e.g., -allprocs, -allframes, etc)
      %1      object type name (e.g., procedures, frames, etc)

 Explanation:
      This message is printed when the user specifies an "-all" flag,
      and no objects of that type are found for the given application. 
      For example, if the user specified -allrecords and there were no
      record types defined for this application, this message would be
      printed.
 
 System Status:
      Notify the user. They should know that the tool found none of
      these objects in the application.

 Recommendation:
      None, unless user expects the application contains an object of
      this type.


E_IE0041_No_Specified_Object "IIEXPORT cannot find `%0c' in this


 Parameters:
      %0      component name 

 Explanation:
      This error occurs when IIEXPORT cannot find the given object on
      the command line. It usually means the object name is
      misspelled, or perhaps that the user specified it as a frame
      when it really is a procedure.
 
 System Status:
      Notify the user. They should know that the tool did not find
      this object in the application.

 Recommendation:
      Reissue, specifying the correct spelling or component type.


E_IE0042_Nothing_Found "IIEXPORT found nothing to export. None of the 


 Parameters:
      None

 Explanation:
      Nothing was found to export. Either the no objects were
      specified, there were none of that component type for this 
      application, or a specific object was misspelled.
 
 System Status:
      Notify the user. The system will exist, and delete the empty
      iiexport intermediate file.

 Recommendation:
      Reissue, specifying valid objects to export.


E_IE0043_FrameProc_Name "Error importing %2c `%1c'. IIMPORT has detected


 Parameters:
      %0      Type (Frame or Procedure) being IMPORTED into the application.
      %1      Name of the object.
      %2      Type (Frame or Procedure) existing in the application.

 Explanation:
      The user is trying to import a frame or procedure of the same
      name, but a different type (user class). This can happen because 
      frames and procedures have different types (e.g, browse, update, 
      append, menu, oslproc, c proc, etc) but share the same name space.
      If the user is trying to change the type of the object, mention
      that that is illegal.
 
 System Status:
      Processing stops.

 Recommendation:
      Rename one of the two objects, and re-run IIEXPORT and IIIMPORT.


E_IE0044_Dupl_File_Name "The -intfile filename  and  the -listing filename


 Parameters:
      none

 Explanation:
      The user is trying to import or export an application and    
      has supplied duplicate file names for the intfile and listing    
      flags. Some platforms will not permit the opening of files with  
      identical names by the same process.
 
 System Status:
      Processing stops.

 Recommendation:
      Provide unique file names, and re-run IIEXPORT or IIIMPORT.

 System Status:
	INGRES/MENU will terminate.

 Recommendation:
	Correctly specify the testing flags.


E_IM0006_User_environment_impr


 Explanation:
	When any INGRES frontend starts up, it first checks a few
	things in the user environment to see if they are set up
	correctly.  This is because disastrous problems could result
	after much work has been done otherwise.  Currently, the only
	check is to see if the temporary area is writable.  This is
	either the user's current directory, or the area pointed to
	by the INGRES name II_TEMPORARY.  If there would be a problem 
	writing a file in this area, this error will occur.

 System Status:
	The program will terminate.

 Recommendation:
	Check the setting for II_TEMPORARY, or see if your working directory
	is writable.  If not, move to another directory in which you
	can write temporary files.


E_IM0007_ingmenu__could_not_se	


 Explanation:
	This should only occur if an internal error occurs.

 System Status:
	The program will terminate.

 Recommendation:
	Contact your INGRES technical support representative.

 Explanation:
	An unexpected statement was reached in the intermediate
	language read by the 4GL interpreter.  For example, a
	statement which should always be preceded by another specific
	statement was found stand-alone.
	Since such an error should never occur, it should be
	reported as a problem to your technical support

E_IT000B_fidbad	"Missing interpreted frame object.\n


 Explanation:
	For some reason, the interpreted frame object associated with an ABF/4GL
	frame or procedure could not be found in the system catalogs.  The frame
	or procedure is associated with an interpreted frame object through an
	identifier stored in the ABF system catalogs, but no object with that
	numeric identifier exists in the object manager system catalogs.  This
	is an unusual condition and may indicate an inconsistency in the INGRES
	system catalogs.

 System Status:
	The frame or procedure cannot be run.  Execution continues from the
	frame or procedure that called the missing frame or procedure, or the
	program exits if the frame or procedure was the top (or entry) object.

	 is exited.  Execution continues with the frame/procedure which
	called it.

 Recommendation:
	Report to INGRES technical support representative.


E_IT000F_frmdisp


 Explanation:
	An error occurred in displaying the specified form for the
	current frame.

 System Status:
	The current frame/procedure is exited.  Execution
	continues with the frame/procedure which called it.

 Recommendation:


E_IT0010_jmpbad


 Explanation:
	An out-of-bounds address was specified for the next
	intermediate language statement to be read by the 4GL interpreter.
	Since such an error should never occur, it should be
	reported as a problem to your technical support
	representative.

 System Status:
	The current frame/procedure is exited.  Execution
	continues with the frame/procedure which called it.

 Recommendation:
	Report to INGRES technical support representative.


E_IT0011_expbad "4GL expression evaluation error.\n


 Explanation:
	The Abstract Data Type facility returned an error status when
	attempting to evaluate an 4GL expression.

 System Status:
	The result of the expression is undefined.
	The current 4GL statement is skipped.  Execution
	continues with the next 4GL statement in the
	frame/procedure.

 Recommendation:


E_IT0012_divzero


 Explanation:

 System Status:
	The result of the expression is undefined.
	The current 4GL statement is skipped.  Execution
	continues with the next 4GL statement in the
	frame/procedure.

 Recommendation:


E_IT0013_numovf


 Explanation:

 System Status:
	The result of the expression is undefined.
	The current 4GL statement is skipped.  Execution
	continues with the next 4GL statement in the
	frame/procedure.

 Recommendation:


E_IT0014_fltbad


 Explanation:

 System Status:
	The result of the expression is undefined.
	The current 4GL statement is skipped.  Execution
	continues with the next 4GL statement in the
	frame/procedure.

 Recommendation:


E_IT0015_imgbad


 Explanation:
	An error occurred in reading the run-time table or image file.
	Since these files are built by ABF, such an error should never
	occur, and should be reported as a problem to your technical support
	representative.

 System Status:
	The current frame/procedure is exited.  Execution
	continues with the frame/procedure which called it.

 Recommendation:
	Report to INGRES technical support representative.


E_IT0016_calbad


 Explanation:
	An error occurred in starting up the frame or procedure
	called within the application.

 System Status:
	The called frame/procedure cannot be run.  Execution
	continues with the frame/procedure which called it.

 Recommendation:


E_IT0017_duparg


 Explanation:
	This error appears when one of the arguments to the 4GL
	interpreter appears in both possible formats:  with and
	without a flag.
	If 'run4gl' has been called from the operating system
	level, re-enter the command with the proper arguments.
	If 'run4gl' has been called within ABF, then the command line
	has been built by ABF, and this error message indicates an internal
	error which should be reported to your technical support
	representative.

 System Status:
	The 4GL interpreter will not start up.

 Recommendation:
	If 'run4gl' was entered from the command line, refer to
	the ABF User's Guide for further information.
	If 'run4gl' was called within ABF, report the problem to
	an INGRES technical support representative.


E_IT0018_nomem


 Explanation:

 System Status:
	If the error occurred while the interpreter was attempting
	to execute a single 4GL statement within a frame, then that
	statement is skipped.  Execution continues with the next 4GL
	statement in the frame/procedure.
	If the error occurred while the interpreter was reading in
	a new frame/procedure, that frame cannot be run.  Execution
	continues with the statement following the call in the
	calling frame/procedure.

 Recommendation:


E_IT0019_sycall


 Explanation:
	An error occurred in attempting to execute an operating system
	command via the 4GL 'call system' statement.

 System Status:
	The current 4GL statement is skipped.  Execution
	continues with the next 4GL statement in the
	frame/procedure.

 Recommendation:


E_IT001A_noobj


 Explanation:
	An ABF object such as a frame could not be found in the
	system catalogs by the Application Object Manager.
	Since such an error should never occur, it should be
	reported as a problem to your technical support
	representative.

 System Status:
	The current frame/procedure is exited.  Execution
	continues with the frame/procedure which called it.

 Recommendation:
	Report to INGRES technical support representative.


E_IT001F_NULLINT


 Explanation:
	Some statements that take integer expressions do not allow
	NULL values.  For example, a table field reference can not
	have a NULL value for the row number.  However, this error
	is not detectable until runtime, since the expression may
	evaluate to a non-NULL value.  The 4GL code needs to be
	changed so that the expression produces a non-NULL value.

 System Status:
	The statement continues with a default value.

 Recommendation:
	Change the 4GL code so that a non-NULL value is produced.


E_IT0020_MaxIL	"4GL source-code exceeded internal limit.\n


 Explanation:
	4GL source-code is translated by the 4GL compilers into an internal
	intermediate code.  The maximum size of this internal intermediate
	code per frame and procedure is limited, and the amount of source-code
	written for the frame or procedure caused the 4GL compilers to exceed
	this limit.

 System Status:
	The 4GL compilation will not complete and no internal intermediate
	code will be generated for the 4GL frame or procedure.

 Recommendation:
	Extract some of the 4GL source-code into separate 4GL procedures (which
	can be called in place of the original source-code.)  This will make the
	source-code smaller and enable it to be compiled.

E_LC0025_READ_ASSOC_FAIL:SS5000M_IPC_ERROR


E_LC0028_AREAD_LOAD_ALLOC:SS50003_EXHAUSTED_RESOURCE


 Parameters:
	%0c	Internal name of message buffer (for example GCA_TUPLES).
	%1c	Size of message buffer in bytes.

 Explanation:
	During a pre-fetch operation (for example, when fetching multiple rows
	of data from a read-only cursor), the run-time system attempts to
	allocate unread message buffers to improve the performance of
	subsequent retrievals against the same data.  When trying to allocate
	one such buffer the system encountered a memory failure.  This is
	normally due to memory resources being exhausted for the process.
	
 System Status:
	The run-time system aborts the current operation.  If this is a cursor
	FETCH operation then the "current" row will have been retrieved, but
	a number of "following" pre-fetched rows will have been discarded.

 Recommendation:
	Confirm that you are not encountering unrelated memory errors that
	could be due to your program corrupting the internal memory management
	lists.  If this only occurs when trying to pre-fetch data then maybe
	the system has exhausted all memory.  For example, a large number of
	read-only cursors all open at the same time, all having set
	the PREFETCHROWS value to a very large number, may encounter this
	error.  This error can be avoided by setting PREFETCHROWS to a low
	number (if the default is too high) or to 1 (which will disable
	message buffering all together).


E_LC0029_AREAD_ROW_COUNT:SS5000L_PROTOCOL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c	Internal name of message buffer (for example GCA_TUPLES).
	%1c	Number of rows originally requested for pre-fetch operation.
	%2c	Number of rows encountered so far.

 Explanation:
	During a pre-fetch operation (for example, when fetching multiple rows
	of data from a read-only cursor), the run-time system collects unread
	rows from the DBMS and saves them away for subsequent retrievals.
	The requested number of rows (determined by the PREFETCHROWS setting or
	the system default) has been exceeded, in violation of the
	client-server GCA protocol.  
	
	A message type of GCA_TUPLES indicates that the actual data exceeded
	the row count.  A message type of GCA_RESPONSE indicates that the
	internal DBMS response count exceeded the value, though the data may
	have been correct (this latter problem is less severe).

 System Status:
	The run-time system aborts the current operation.  If this is a cursor
	FETCH operation then the "current" row will have been retrieved, but
	a number of "following" pre-fetched rows will have been discarded.

 Recommendation:
	If this is repeatedly encountered then try setting PREFETCHROWS to 1
	which will disable the pre-fetch operation.


E_LC002A_AREAD_WRONG_MESSAGE:SS5000L_PROTOCOL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c	Internal name of message buffers that are expected.
	%1c	Internal name of message buffer encountered.

 Explanation:
	During a pre-fetch operation (for example, when fetching multiple rows
	of data from a read-only cursor), the run-time system collects unread
	messages from the DBMS and saves them away for subsequent retrievals.
	During this operation the system encountered an unexpected message,
	in violation of the client-server GCA protocol.  The message could not
	be interpreted in the current context.

 System Status:
	The run-time system aborts the current operation.  If this is a cursor
	FETCH operation then the "current" row will have been retrieved, but
	a number of "following" pre-fetched rows will have been discarded.

 Recommendation:
	If this is repeatedly encountered then try setting PREFETCHROWS to 1
	which will disable the pre-fetch operation.


E_LC002B_AREAD_SHORT_DATA:SS5000L_PROTOCOL_ERROR


 Parameters:
	%0c	Number of bytes expected to read.
	%1c	Number of bytes actually read when end of stream encountered.
	%2c	Message where data was being read from.

 Explanation:
	During a read operation from a pre-fetched data stream (for example,
	when multiple rows of data from a read-only cursor have been
	pre-fetched and more data is now being retrieved), the run-time system
	encountered the early termination of the data stream.

 System Status:
	The run-time system aborts the current operation.  If this is a cursor
	FETCH operation then the "current" row will not have been retrieved,
	but subsequent FETCH operations should succeed.

 Recommendation:
	If this is repeatedly encountered then try setting PREFETCHROWS to 1
	which will disable the pre-fetch operation.  If you encountered
	earlier errors while trying to retrieve from the same cursor, then
	correct those errors and try again.

 Parameters:
	%0c	Number of rows that the cursor is pre-fetching.
	%1c	Name of cursor whose data is being retrieved.

 Explanation:
	During a pre-fetch operation (for example, when fetching multiple rows
	of data from a read-only cursor), the run-time system collects unread
	rows from the DBMS and saves them away for subsequent retrievals.
	This operation encountered an error whose text can be retrieved (or
	displayed) together with this error message.

 System Status:
	The run-time system aborts the current operation.  The "current" row
	will have been retrieved, but a number of "following" pre-fetched rows
	are discarded.

 Recommendation:
	If this is repeatedly encountered then try setting PREFETCHROWS to 1
	(using SET_INGRES or II_EMBED_SET) which will disable the pre-fetch
	operation.

E_LS0110_PACKTOF8:SS22003_NUM_VAL_OUT_OF_RANGE	


 Arguments:
	%0 - Digit stream extracted from the COMP-3 data-item.
	%1 - PICTURE string for data-item.

 Explanation:
	When assigning COMP or COMP-3 scaled data-items into INGRES the
	preprocessor generates a conversion call to convert these
	values to floating-point format.  When executing this conversion
	the system failed.  

	Note that scaled COMP data items are moved into an internal COMP-3
	data item before this conversion.

 System Status:
	The invalid value is not assigned into INGRES and 0.0 is used.

 Recommendation:
	Check that you use a standard COBOL assignment to assign a value
	to your COMP or COMP-3 data item.  An uninitialized or badly linked
	(or pointed at) data-item may have invalid bytes in the numeric field.


E_LS0111_F8TOPACK:SS22003_NUM_VAL_OUT_OF_RANGE	


 Arguments:
	%0 - Digit stream extracted from the internal FLOAT8.
	%1 - PICTURE string for data-item.

 Explanation:
	When retrieving from INGRES into a COMP or COMP-3 scaled data-item
	the preprocessor uses a temporary internal floating-point data-item
	and then generates a conversion call to convert that temporary
	value into your data-item.  When executing this conversion the
	system failed as the digit stream was too large to fit into 
	your data-item.

	Note that scaled COMP data items are assigned from an internal COMP-3
	data item after the above conversion.

 System Status:
	The value in the digit stream is truncated from the left to allow
	it to fit.  This is not the same as the COBOL Standard Alignment Rules.

 Recommendation:
	Provide a larger data-item to include the significant digits
	that are being truncated.


E_LS0112_STRTOF8:SS22000_DATA_EXCEPTION	


 Arguments:
	%0 - Digit stream generated by the COBOL preprocessor

 Explanation:
	On an assignment statement from COBOL into the INGRES run-time
	system, a floating-point literal was used.  The preprocessor 
	generates a conversion from the literal to an internal floating-point
	using a run-time conversion.  The generated numeric string could
*	not be correctly converted.

 System Status:
	The value is not converted and 0.0 is used instead.

 Recommendation:
	Recheck the floating-point literal (and, if necessary, the
	generated COBOL code).


E_LS0113_CALLPACK:SS22000_DATA_EXCEPTION	


 Arguments:
	%0 - The conversion procedure that was called.
	%1 - The extra arguments that were used.
	%2 - The argument number and the reason the argument is invalid.

 Explanation:
	Some C routines have been provided to allow you to use COMP-3
	data-items with INGRES.  Normally the preprocessor hides this
	interface from you, but in some cases, such as Dynamic SQL, this
	interface is hard-coded.  In that case all arguments are validated
	before any conversion take place.  The rules associated with these
	interfaces are described in the INGRES Embedded COBOL manuals.
	The called routine has detected an inconsistency.

 System Status:
	The conversion does not take place and the result data is not
	modified.

 Recommendation:
	Recheck the hard-coded call and validate your arguments.


E_M10000_NoDB	"Error connecting to database `%0c'.\n"


 Explanation:
	The FormIndex command could not successfully connect to the named
	database most likely because the database does not exist, or possibly
	because the commands specified using the ING_SET environment logical
	are in error.

	Occasionally, successful database connection may be precluded by
	other errors (e.g., GCA errors, etc.) usually evidence of some sort
	of installation problem or hardware or system failure.

 System Status:
	Program terminates.

 Recommendation:
	Check that the database exists and create it if it does not.  If the
	database name was specified on the command line, check that it was
	specified correctly and re-enter the command line.  Also, check that
	the commands specified using the ING_SET logical are correct.


 Explanation:
	The FormIndex command must have the Form Index file name and at least
	one editing command specified on the command line.

 System Status:
	Program terminates.

 Recommendation:
	Specify the required arguments.


E_M10013_CantCreate	"Form Index file creation error.\n


 Explanation:
	The Form Index file module could not create the file that will contain
	a Form Index.  This could be for any number of reasons, but most likely
	is because you do not have access rights to the directory where the file
	is to be created or because you have exceeded the disk space available
	to you in this directory.

 System Status:
	Program terminates.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that you have access rights to the directory where the Form
	Index file is to be created and also that sufficient disk space is
	available to you in that directory.  Also, check that the you correctly
	specified the name of the Form Index file.


E_M10014_CantOpen	"Form Index file open error.\n


 Explanation:
	The named Form Index file cannot be opened.  This could be because the
	file does not exist in the installation for the language specified by
	the II_LANGUAGE environment logical, or because the file does not have
	the proper read access rights.  Another possibility is that the name
	specified for the Form Index file using the II_FORMFILE environment
	logical is incorrect.

	Also possible is that the file could not be opened for writing because
	another program has already opened it for either reading or writing,
	which might occur on some operating systems when running the FormIndex
	command.

 System Status:
	Program terminates.

 Recommendation:
	Check with your system administrator that the language specified by the
	environment logical II_LANGUAGE is correct and that the Form Index file
	exists in the II_CONFIG installation for this language and has the
	correct access rights.  Also, check that any file name specified using
	the environment logical II_FORMFILE is correct.


E_M10015_BadVersion	"Incompatible Form Index file version.\n


 Explanation:
	The version of the named Form Index file is not compatible with
	the version that the current installation supports.

 System Status:
	Program terminates.

 Recommendation:
	Check with your system administrator to verify that the installation is
	correct, and that the Form Index file is compatible with this version.


E_M10016_BadIndex	"Error reading index for Form Index file.\n


 Explanation:
	The index table in the Form Index file could not be read, which might
	be because the installation is incorrect.  Otherwise, this is because
	of an internal programming error.

 System Status:
	Program terminates.

 Recommendation:
	Report this problem to your technical support representative.


E_M1001B_BadName	"Form name '%0c' is not a legal form name.\n


 Explanation:
	The name of the form specified on the FormIndex command line is
	not a legal name for a form.  Names specified for forms on the
	command line are either legal Ingres form names or are a file name
	with the extension ".frm" (which contains a CopyForm format of the
	form.)

 System Status:
	No action (replace, append, delete) will be performed on the form
	in the Form Index file.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that the form names listed on the command line are correct.


E_M1001D_NoForm	"Non-existent form in Form Index.\n


 Explanation:
	The index in the Form Index file does not list the named form.

 System Status:
	Program terminates.

 Recommendation:
	Use correct form name.


E_M1001E_AlreadyExists	"Form of name '%0c' already exists.\n


 System Status:
	This form will not be added to the file.

 Recommendation:
	Use -m flag to replace a form.


E_M10021_IndexFull	"Form Index file index table full.\n


 Explanation:
	The internal number of indexes available in a Form Index file is set
	at the time the file was created.  This number has now been exceeded.
	Please report this problem to your RT Engineering contact so that this
	number can be increased.

 System Status:
	Program terminates.

 Recommendation:
	The number of indexes available is a hard limit large enough for all
	forms used by RT products.  Too many files have been placed in the
	Form Index file:  Use fewer forms.


E_M10022_BadRetrieve	"Encoded form fetch error.\n


 Explanation:
	A DBMS error occurred when this form was fetched from the database.

 System Status:
	Program terminates without replacing or appending the form in the
	Form Index file.

 Recommendation:
	Try again if a deadlock error occurred.  Otherwise, talk to
	your system administrator.


E_M10023_NoEncodedForm	"Missing encoded form.\n


 Explanation:
	No rows for the encoded form were found in the system table.

 System Status:
	Program Exits.

 Recommendation:
	Use correct form name, or check form ownership.


E_M10024_BadEncodedForm	"Incomplete encoded form.\n


 Explanation:
	Not all the rows for the encoded form could be fetched from the
	database.  This is because Vifred or CopyForm failed to write all
	the rows, or because the DBMS failed to write or fetch all the
	rows.  This is an internal programming problem.

 System Status:
	Program Exits.

 Recommendation:
	Report this problem to your technical representative.


E_M10030_BadForm	"Error reading form from Form Index file.\n


 Explanation:
	A read error occurred when an encoded form was being read in from the
	Form Index file.  Most likely this is because of a system error or
	disk error.  Less likely, this is because of some internal programming
	error that occurred when the encoded form was inserted into the Form
	Index file.

 System Status:
	Since the form could not be read into the program, it will likely
	terminate.

 Recommendation:
	Report this problem to your technical representative.


E_MC0001_NOEFILE	"%0c: No error file specified with -e option."


 Explanation:
	-e option was used without a filename attached.

 System Status:
	program exits.

 Recommendation:
	Use option correctly.


E_MC0002_USAGE		"Usage: %0c [-e<errfile>] <character set> <file>"


 Explanation:
	Bad command line syntax.

 System Status:
	program exits.

 Recommendation:
	Specify proper command line arguments.


E_MC0003_FILEOPEN	"%0c: Can't open file `%1c' for %2c"


 Explanation:
	A file could not be opened, either the input file or the error
	output file.

 System Status:
	program exits.

 Recommendation:
	Address the file problem (file may not exist, permission problems,
	etc.) and rerun command.


E_MC0004_READFAIL	"%0c: Read failure on input."


 Explanation:
	Read from the input file failed.

 System Status:
	program exits.

 Recommendation:
	Address the file i/o error and rerun the command.


E_MC0005_SYNTAXERR	"%0c: Errors encountered in file `%1c'."


 Explanation:
	Errors were encountered in the file.  More explicit messages
	have already been produced for the individual errors.

 System Status:
	program exits.

 Recommendation:
	Fix the errors, and rerun command.


E_MC0006_CASEBOUNDS	"%0c, line %1d: Translation to lower case results in


 Explanation:
	A character given as an upper case character possesses a lower case
	translation, either explicitly specified, or defaulted by adding
	'a' - 'A', which is outside the range 0-255.

 System Status:
	Error counted.  Processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Translate case properly.


E_MC0007_BADHEX		"%0c, line %1d: Bad hexadecimal code.  `%2c' found


 Explanation:
	Improper specification of a hexadecimal number.

 System Status:
	Error counted.  Processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Specify a legal value.


E_MC0008_DUPCODE	"%0c, line %1d: Hexadecimal code %2x specified


 Explanation:
	A given hexadecimal code was already specified in an earlier
	line of the file.

 System Status:
	Error counted.  Processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Only specify a given character once.


E_MC0009_BADRANGE	"%0c, line %1d: Improper use of `-' in hexadecimal


 Explanation:
	A hexadecimal range contained a '-' either at the front or the
	end of the range.  "-" must appear between two hexadecimal numbers.

 System Status:
	Error counted.  Processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Specify range properly.


E_MC000A_BADORDER	"%0c, line %1d: Hexadecimal codes ordered incorrectly."


 Explanation:
	Second number of hexadecimal range is smaller than first.  Admittedly,
	we could just reverse these, but the syntax of this file is esoteric
	enough that expecting people to enter ranges in order is not much of
	an imposition.  This may catch a typo.

 System Status:
	Error counted.  Processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Give ranges as <low code>-<high code>


E_MC000B_ILLCHAR	"%0c, line %1d: Hexadecimal code outside range 0-255."


 Explanation:
	A hexadecimal character code was not in the range 0-255.

 System Status:
	Error counted.  Processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Specify only codes in the legal range.


E_MC000C_ALPHABIT	"%0c, line %1d: Incompatible case attributes specified.


 Explanation:
	Attribute bits given contained conflicting case attributes.  A
	character can only be one of upper, lower, or non-cased.

 System Status:
	Error counted.  Processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Specify non-conflicting attributes.


E_MC000D_PRINTBIT	"%0c, line %1d: Incompatible printability


 Explanation:
	Attribute bits given contained both the "p" and "c" characters.
	A character cannot be classified as both "control" and "printable".

 System Status:
	Error counted.  Processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Specify non-conflicting attributes.


E_MC000E_ILLATTR	"%0c, line %1d: Illegal attribute code - `%2c'."


 Explanation:
	The attribute field of the line contained an illegal character.

 System Status:
	Error counted.  Processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Specify legal attribute characters.


E_MC000F_XLBAD		"Upper case hexadecimal character code %2x


 Explanation:
	A character classified as upper case was given a case translation
	to a character not classified as lower case.

 System Status:
	Error counted.  Processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Translate upper case characters ONLY to lower case.  Remember that
	if an explicit translation is not given, one is obtained by adding
	'a' - 'A' to the value.  If an alphabetic character has no case
	translation, it must be classified as non-cased alpha.


E_MC0010_MANYTO1	"Hexadecimal code %2x is the case translation of more


 Explanation:
	Multiple upper case characters were translated to the same lower
	case character.  This makes it impossible to specify the proper
	upper case translation of that lower case character.

 System Status:
	Error counted.  Processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that all upper case characters have distinct lower case
	translations.


E_MC0011_NOUPPER	"Lower case hexadecimal code %2x has no upper case


 Explanation:
	A lower case character exists which is not the lower case translation
	of any upper case character.

 System Status:
	Error counted.  Processing continues.

 Recommendation:
	Translate some upper case character to this one, or make the character
	non-cased alpha.


E_MC0012_TOOMANY	"%0c: Too many errors."


 Explanation:
 	Too many errors have been encountered in processing the file.

 System Status:
	program exits.

 Recommendation:
	Fix the errors and rerun the program.


E_MC0013_CMWRTERR	"%0c: Cannot write attributes - %1c."


 Explanation:
	Attempt to install the attributes failed.  Parameter should be
	a more specific error.

 System Status:
	program exits.

 Recommendation:
	Address the specific error message.


E_MC0014_ABORT		"Character set not installed."


 Explanation:
	Final message on all error exits.

 System Status:
	program exits.

 Recommendation:
	Address the earlier error messages.

 Recommendation:
	If you issued the osl or oslsql command, supply a -d flag
	and re-issue the command.  If the error occurred when you selected
	'Compile' or 'Go' during an ABF session, report the error
	to your technical representative.


E_OS0001	"The input file '%0c' could not be opened.\n


 Explanation:
	4GL could not open the source file that it is to compile either because
	it does not exist or because you do not have access rights to read it.

	4GL will terminate with a fatal status.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative.


E_OS0003	"No form was specified for this frame.\n


 Explanation:
	4GL frames require a form to be specified when they are defined.
	The frame cannot be compiled unless this is true.

 System Status:
	4GL will terminate with an error status.

 Recommendation:
	Specify a form in the appropriate field in the ABF user frame
	definition frame.


E_OS0004	"The listing file '%0c' could not be opened.\n


 Explanation:
	4GL could not open the specified file to write a program listing for
	the source file being compiled.  This could be for any number of
	reasons, but most likely is because you do not have access rights to
	the current directory or because you do not have enough disk space
	available to create files in that directory.

 System Status:
	4GL will continue compile the source file, but no listing will
	be produced.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that the you have access rights to the current directory
	and enough disk space to create files there before reporting this
	problem to your technical representative.


E_OS000A_TypeMismatch	"Source file and ABF catalog specify different


 Explanation:
	When you created this object you told ABF that it was a frame,
	but your source file appears to define a 4GL procedure (or vice versa).

 System Status:
	The ABF catalog will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the source file, or delete the frame/procedure object
	and recreate it as the other type.


E_OS000B_TooManyArgs	"Too many source files in command-line\n


 Explanation:
	The 4GL compiler (osl or oslsql) was passed more than one source file.
	(Any argument not beginning with '-' or '+' is taken to be a source file
	name).

 System Status:
	The 4GL compiler will terminate with a fatal status.

 Recommendation:
	If you issued the osl or oslsql command, correct the command
	and re-issue it.  If the error occurred when you selected
	'Compile' or 'Go' during an ABF session, report the error
	to your technical representative.


E_OS000C_BadArg		"Invalid command-line argument\n


 Explanation:
	The 4GL compiler (osl or oslsql) was passed an invalid argument.

 System Status:
	The 4GL compiler will terminate with a fatal status.

 Recommendation:
	If you issued the osl or oslsql command, correct the command
	and re-issue it.  If the error occurred when you selected
	'Compile' or 'Go' during an ABF session, report the error
	to your technical representative.


E_OS000D_BadFrameOrProc	"Bad frame or procedure\n


 Explanation:
	The 4GL compiler (osl or oslsql) could not retrieve
	the requested frame or procedure from the ABF catalog.
	Either the -a or -f flag was missing or invalid,
	or the ABF catalog contains invalid data.

 System Status:
	The 4GL compiler will terminate with a fatal status.

 Recommendation:
	If you issued the osl or oslsql command, correct the -a or -f flag
	and re-issue the command.  If the error occurred when you selected
	'Compile' or 'Go' during an ABF session, report the error
	to your technical representative.


E_OS0010	"An internal problem exists within the 4GL compiler.\n


 Explanation:
	An internal consistency check failed in the 4GL compiler in the
	indicated routine.  This is an internal program error.

 System Status:
	4GL will terminate with a fatal status.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative noting the routine
	specification in the body of the message and the number of the line
	that was being compiled.


E_OS0011	"The 4GL compiler ran out of memory.\n


 Explanation:
	The 4GL compiler could not allocate any more memory required to compile
	the 4GL frame or procedure.  This is an internal program error.

 System Status:
	4GL will terminate with a fatal status.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative noting the routine
	specification in the body of the message and the number of the line
	that was being compiled.


E_OS0012	"Badly formed statement within 4GL compiler.  A value was


 Explanation:
	The 4GL compiler had an internal consistency check failure while
	building a statement parse tree.  This is an internal program error.

 System Status:
	4GL will terminate with a fatal status.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative noting the type
	specification in the body of the message and the number of the line
	that was being compiled.


E_OS0013	"Badly formed statement within 4GL compiler.  A value was


 Explanation:
	The 4GL compiler had an internal consistency check failure while
	building a statement parse tree.  This is an internal program error.

 System Status:
	4GL will terminate with a fatal status.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative noting the type
	specification in the body of the message and the number of the line
	that was being compiled.


E_OS0014	"Badly formed expression within 4GL compiler while compiling


 Explanation:
	The 4GL compiler had an internal consistency check failure while
	building an expression parse tree.  This is an internal program error.

 System Status:
	4GL will terminate with a fatal status.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative noting the line
	that was being compiled.


E_OS0020	"The form '%0c' does not exist in the Form System Catalogs,


 Explanation:
	The form specified for the 4GL frame does not exist, or exists
	but is not accessible to you.

 System Status:
	4GL will terminate with an error status.

 Recommendation:
	Verify that the name of the form is correct, or 


E_OS0021	"Invalid fields on form.\n


 Explanation:
	4GL detected an inconsistency in the Form System catalogs in that
	two fields have the same name.  This is an internal FRS problem.

 System Status:
	4GL will terminate with a fatal status.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative.


E_OS0022	"Invalid table field on form.\n


 Explanation:
	4GL detected an inconsistency in the Form System catalogs in that
	a field has the same name as a table field.  This is an internal FRS
	problem.

 System Status:
	4GL will terminate with a fatal status.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative.


E_OS0023	"Invalid columns on form.\n


 Explanation:
	4GL detected an inconsistency in the Form System catalogs in that
	two columns for a table field have the same name.  This is an internal
	FRS problem.

 System Status:
	4GL will terminate with a fatal status.

 Recommendation:
	Report this error to your technical representative.


E_OS0024	"Duplicate variable or local procedure declaration.\n


 Explanation:
	The frame or 4GL procedure already has a field, table field, variable,
	or local procedure with the same name as the variable or local procedure
	that is being defined.  Because this is ambiguous, you should use
	a different name for the variable or local procedure.

 System Status:
	The definition of this variable or local procedure will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Use a different name for the variable or local procedure.


E_OS0025	"Duplicate column declaration.\n


 Explanation:
	The table field on the form specified for the 4GL frame has a
	column with the same name as the hidden column that is being declared
	for this table field.  Because this is ambiguous, you should use a
	different name for the hidden column.

 System Status:
	The definition of this hidden column will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Use a different name for the hidden column.


E_OS0026	"Invalid datatype.\n


 Explanation:
	The hidden field or column definition did not specify
	a recognized INGRES data type.

 System Status:
	The type of this hidden field or column will be undefined.

 Recommendation:
	Consult the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual to determine those types
	that are recognized, and then correct the hidden field or column
	declaration.


E_OS0027	"Invalid data size.\n


 Explanation:
	The hidden field or column definition did not specify
	a recognized INGRES data type size.

 System Status:
	The type of this hidden field or column will be undefined.

 Recommendation:
	Consult the INGRES ABF/4GL Reference Manual to determine those types
	that are recognized, and then correct the hidden field or column
	declaration.


E_OS0028	"Duplicate constant declaration.\n


 Explanation:
	The frame or 4GL procedure already has a field, table field, hidden
	field or constant with the same name as the constant that is being
	defined.  Because this is ambiguous, the constant cannot have this name.

 System Status:
	The definition of this constant will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Use a different name for the constant.


E_OS0029	"Declared procedure name mis-match.\n


 Explanation:
	The name of the procedure defined in ABF does not match the name
	of the procedure syntactically specified in the 4GL source code
	for the procedure.  (That is, as "procedure <name> ...".)

 System Status:
	4GL will terminate.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the name of the procedure as defined in ABF matches the
	name of the procedure specified in the 4GL source code file.


E_OS0030	"Syntax error on line '%0d'.  Unexpected End-Of-File."


E_OS0031	"Unterminated comment."


 Explanation:
	The 4GL scanner detected a comment (beginning with "/*") that was not
	terminated (by a "* /"; note: no space) before the End-of-File was seen.
	This usually means you forgot or mis-typed the comment terminator
	character sequence.

 System Status:
	4GL could not determine where the comment ended and assumed the rest
	of the source file was a comment.  Since no more lines can be compiled,
	the compilation will be terminated with an error status.

 Recommendation:
	Insert the comment termination sequence "* /" (note:  no space) at the
	appropriate place after the comment that caused the error.  Then compile
	the source file.


E_OS0032	"Unterminated string constant (strings cannot span lines.)"


 Explanation:
	You probably forgot to terminate the string with a string delimiter
	character.  Strings cannot contain embedded new-lines.  The string on
	this line must be terminated with a string delimiter character also on
	this line.

 System Status:
	The string will be terminated at the new-line and parsing will continue.
	This may inadvertently result in spurious errors being recognized.  The
	source file will not be compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Terminate the string with a string delimiter character.  Or, if you
	want a new-line to be embedded in the string, use text notation ('\n')
	in 4GL/QUEL, or use hexadecimal specification (X'0C', ASCII) in 4GL/SQL.
	Then compile the source file.


E_OS0033	"String constant too long for 4GL.  The limit is 253,


E_OS0034	"Bad number `%0c' in ERROR comment."	/* DIAG */


E_OS0035	"Bad number `%0c' in LINE comment."	/* DIAG */


E_OS0036	"Bad number `%0c' in special comment."	/* DIAG */


E_OS0037	"Warning:  Strings delimited by double-quotes (\") are


 Explanation:
	4GL/SQL no longer supports strings delimited by double-quotes (").

 System Status:
	The string will be converted to a single-quote string if it contains
	only printable characters or a hexadecimal string if it does not.  No
	error will be generated.

 Recommendation:
	Use single-quotes (') to delimit strings or use the hexadecimal
	notation in 4GL/SQL.


E_OS0038	"String constant is too long for 4GL.  The limit is 253,


E_OS0039	"Invalid single-quote on line '%0d.'\n


E_OS003A_UntermDelimID	"Unterminated delimited identifier (delimited\n


 Explanation:
	You probably forgot to terminate a delimited identifier with a double
	quote.  Delimited identifiers cannot contain embedded new-lines.  The 
	delimited identifier on this line must be terminated with a double quote
	character also on this line.

 System Status:
	The delimited identifier will be terminated at the new-line and parsing 
	will continue.  This may inadvertently result in spurious errors being 
	recognized.  The source file will not be compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Terminate the delimited identifier with a double quote character.
	Then re-compile the source file.


E_OS0040	"Hexadecimal string constant is too long for 4GL.  The limit


E_OS0041	"An invalid character was used in a hexadecimal string constant


E_OS0042	"Hexadecimal string constants must contain an even number of


E_OS0050_BadDecimal	"A bad value was given in II_4GL_DECIMAL.\n


 Explanation:
	The character given in II_4GL_DECIMAL is not a valid decimal point
	character.  This is the character you have used in 4GL source
	statements to specify numeric literals that can have a fractional part,
	such as money values or real numbers.  Valid decimal point characters
	are `.' or `,'.  Important note: this logical symbol is provided
	only for backward compatibility.  It is recommended that you use
	a decimal point character of `.' in your 4GL source code,
	and leave II_4GL_DECIMAL unset (it will default to `.').

 System Status:
	The 4GL compiler will assume that your 4GL statements will use
	a decimal point character of `.' to specify the fractional parts
	of numeric literals.  If your 4GL statements in fact use some other
	character, a syntax error will be reported.

 Recommendation:
	Set a valid single-character string for the II_4GL_DECIMAL name.


E_OS0060_BadProcName	"Invalid procedure name qualification.\n


 Explanation:
	The name of the procedure specified in a local procedure declaration
	contains a period. Procedure names must begin with a letter
	and contain only alphanumeric characters. Procedure names may not
	be qualified.

 System Status:
	The local procedure declaration will be ignored.	

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the name of the procedure is spelled correctly.


E_OS0061_DupProcDecl	"Duplicate procedure declaration.\n


 Explanation:
	The name of the procedure specified in a local procedure declaration
	has already appeared in an earlier local procedure declaration or
	definition (the body of a local procedure),
	or else it's the name of the frame's form (if this is a frame),
	or else it's the name of the main procedure (if this is a procedure),

 System Status:
	The local procedure declaration will be ignored.	

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the name of the procedure is unique.


E_OS0062_AmbiguousVar	"Ambiguous variable name.\n


 Explanation:
	The name of the variable specified in a variable declaration is also
	the name of the local procedure in which the declaration appears,
	or else it's the name of a "higher" local procedure (whose variables
	are visible to the local procedure in which the declaration appears),
	or else it's the name of the frame's form (if this is a frame),
	or else it's the name of the main procedure (if this is a procedure),

 System Status:
	The variable declaration will be processed, but subsequent references
	to the variable may be interpreted as references to the procedure or
	form of the same name, or vice versa.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the name of the variable is unique.


E_OS0063_BadProcType	"Invalid procedure return type.\n


 Explanation:
	A local procedure has been declared to return a complex type.
	Procedures must return a simple type or "none".

 System Status:
	The procedure declaration will be processed as if a return type
	of "none" were specified.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the return type of the procedure is a valid simple type
	or "none".


E_OS0064_MisplacedProcDecl "Misplaced local procedure declaration.\n


 Explanation:
	Local procedure declarations should appear in the DECLARE section
	of the INITIALIZE statement (if they're used by a frame)
	or in the DECLARE section of a procedure (if they're used by
	that procedure).

 System Status:
	The local procedure declaration will be processed anyway.
	The error, however, is fatal.  (In future releases, a local procedure
	declaration as a parameter may have a different meaning).

 Recommendation:
	Move the local procedure declaration into the DECLARE section.


E_OS0065_ProcNotDecl	"Procedure not declared.\n


 Explanation:
	The name specified in the definition of a local procedure
	has not yet appeared in any local procedure declaration.
	A local procedure must be declared before it's defined.

 System Status:
	A declaration of PROCEDURE RETURNING NONE is assumed.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the procedure is declared before it's defined.


E_OS0066_DupProcDefn	"Duplicate procedure definition.\n


 Explanation:
	The name of the procedure specified in a local procedure definition
	has already appeared in an earlier local procedure definition,
	or else it's the name of the frame's form (if this is a frame),
	or else it's the name of the main procedure (if this is a procedure),

 System Status:
	The 4GL compiler will examine the procedure definition
	for further errors.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the name of the procedure is unique.


E_OS0067_ProcNotDefn	"Procedure not defined.\n


 Explanation:
	The name specified in a local procedure declaration
	never appeared in any local procedure definition.
	Each local procedure must be declared and defined exactly once.

 System Status:
	A fatal error is reported.

 Recommendation:
	Change the 4GL source program to define the procedure,
	or remove the declaration of the procedure and all references to it.


E_OS0068_BadProcRef	"Invalid reference to local procedure.\n


 Explanation:
	A reference was made to a local procedure where a reference to
	a variable or constant was expected.

 System Status:
	The local procedure specification will be ignored.	
	Further error messages may appear.

 Recommendation:
	Specify a variable or constant instead of a local procedure.

 Explanation:
	When the '-wopen' flag is given to ABF, the 4GL/SQL compiler will
	produce warning messages when it encounters statements that are not
	part of the Open SQL specification.

 System Status:
	None.

 Recommendation:
	If you want to build applications to be used on heterogeneous DBMS
	systems using an INGRES/Gateway, you should not use any statements
	that produce this warning message.


E_OS0110	"An assignment statement had incompatible types between


E_OS0111 "Warning:  Nullable expression assigned to non-Nullable variable.\n


E_OS0112	"Operands acted on by the operator '%0c'


 Explanation:
	An expression specified an operation on two or more operands that had
	incompatible or illegal types for such an operation.  For example, a
	date and a number are incompatible types and cannot be compared using
	any of the relational operators such as '='.  Or as another example,
	strings are illegal operands for any operator but '+'.

	Also, an expression may have specified an operation using an ADF
	function such as 'left()' or 'concat()' with too many operands.  For
	example, both of the preceding functions require exactly two operands.

 System Status:
	Neither the expression nor the source file will be compiled, but
	the source file will be checked for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the operation.


E_OS0113	"An operand acted on by the operator


 Explanation:
	An expression specified a unary operation on an operand that had an
	illegal type for such an operation.  For example, the unary minus
	operation cannot be applied to any but a numeric or money operand.

 System Status:
	Neither the expression nor the source file will be compiled, but
	the source file will be checked for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the operation.


E_OS0114	"An operand acted on by the logical


 Explanation:
	A logical expression specified a logical operation (either AND, OR or
	NOT) on an operand (expression) that was not a boolean type.  Boolean
	expressions are either other logical expressions or an expression
	specifying a relational operation (e.g., "<=" or "like".)

 System Status:
	Neither the logical expression nor the source file will be compiled,
	but the source file will be checked for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the logical expression.


E_OS0115	"The undefined symbol '%0c' was referenced

E_OS0118	"The undefined symbol '%0c' was used in an


E_OS0119	"The field or column used in an assignment


E_OS011A	"The symbol '%0c' was used in an assignment statement


 Explanation:
	The symbol being assigned to in an assignment statement (on the
	left-hand side of the assignment operator, '=' or ':=') is a constant
	or a table.  Constants have a single (constant) value assigned to them
	by definition and cannot have other values assigned to them.  Tables
	cannot have values assigned in this way.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that the symbol being assigned to represents a field or
	column and then compile the source file.


E_OS011B	"Warning:  Superfluous use of ':' to dereference a field


 Explanation:
	The field or column being assigned to is superfluously dereferenced by
	':'.  In some contexts such as when accessing the DBMS or the Forms
	System, 4GL expects symbols to represent names rather than values.  But
	within that context, 4GL also allows reference to be made to a value
	that will contain the name by allowing use of the dereference indicator,
	':'.  Assignments, however, always unambiguously refer to fields or
	columns on the form and should not be dereferenced by ':'.

 System Status:
	4GL will ignore the superfluous ':' and continue compiling the source
	file.

 Recommendation:
	Edit the source file and remove any superfluous ':'.


E_OS011C	"Operands passed to the function '%0c'


 Explanation:
	An expression specified an internal built-in function operating on zero
	or more operands that had illegal types or were incorrect in number for
	such a function.  For example, the 'length()' function operates on
	exactly one argument of a string type, no more, no less.

 System Status:
	Neither the expression nor the source file will be compiled, but
	the source file will be checked for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the function call.


E_OS011D "Warning:  Possible Null used when a non-Null value is required.\n


 Explanation:
	A field or column that is of Nullable type was used in a context that
	will not recognize a Null value if the field or column should contain
	one.  Such contexts include form or field names, etc.  4GL warns about
	these cases because if a Null value happens to be used here at runtime
	an error will occur and further behavior of the application may be
	unpredictable.

 System Status:
	The 4GL frame or procedure will be compiled assuming no other errors
	occur.  However, if by chance at runtime a Null value is placed in
	the variable and it is used in this context, a runtime error will be
	reported and the statement will be aborted with unpredictable results.

 Recommendation:
	Define the field or column to be NOT NULL.  Null values are illegal in
	this context so the field or column (usually a hidden one) should be
	non-Nullable.


E_OS011E	"Illegal operand passed to a function."


 Explanation:
	A function was called with an illegal operand.  For example, 
	a table field may have been passed to a host-language procedure.

 System Status:
	Neither the expression nor the source file will be compiled, but
	the source file will be checked for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the function call.


E_OS0120	"An expression or value of a character type is required in


 Explanation:
	4GL requires a string-valued expression in the context being translated,
	e.g., as the `message' for a message statement.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement.


E_OS0121	"A expression or value of integer type is required,


E_OS0122	"A string or integer reference is required in


 Explanation:
	
 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the statement.


E_OS0123	"A string value or field or column reference of


 Explanation:
	4GL requires a string value in the specified context.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that a string value is specified in the required context
	and then compile the source file.

E_OS012F	"Warning:  No return value.  The frame or procedure


 Explanation:
	A return statement with no return value was recognized in the source for
	a frame or procedure that was defined as returning a value.  Although a
	default value will be returned, it is likely that you forgot to return
	a value for the frame or procedure.  Also possible is that you defined
	the frame or procedure as returning a value when no values should ever
	be returned for it.

 System Status:
	Compilation will continue with no errors.  At run-time a default value
	will be returned for the frame or procedure.

 Recommendation:
	Always explicitly return a value for frames or procedures that have been
	defined as returning a value.  Or, if the frame or procedure is not
	supposed to return values, define it as such.

	where <value> can be a number if <format> is numeric or a hex
	constant like X'393939' for the string '999' or a quoted string
	constant like 'NULL'. An unquoted string is not allowed.

 System Status:
      The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be

 Explanation:
	At the moment, 4GL only supports passing a single query (master-detail
	or otherwise) as a parameter to an 4GL frame.  More than one such query
	was specified in the parameter list for the CALLFRAME statement being
	compiled and is an error.

 System Status:
	Additional query parameters will be ignored, and although the source
	file will be checked for other errors, it will not be compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Change the parameter list so that it contains only one query and then
	compile the source file.


E_OS0159	"Non-existent query object, '%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	A query object was expected either as the target of an assignment
	(on the left-hand side) or as a value list (as part of a ".all")
	in a query statement.  The name used to refer to the query object
	is not the name of the form, nor does it name a table field on
	the form, an array, a row of a table field or array, or a record.
	These are the only defined query objects for a frame or procedure.

 System Status:
	The query statement will be ignored, and although the source file will
	be checked for other errors, it will not be compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Correct the name to be a defined query object and then compile the file.


E_OS015A_BadRepeat	"Warning: query is not repeatable.\n


 Explanation:
	The REPEAT (QUEL) or REPEATED (SQL) keyword was specified on a query.
	However, the query contains a variable reference in a context
	which is not proper for a repeated query.  Examples of such
	improper contexts are using a string variable to specify an entire
	WHERE clause or to specify the name of a DBMS object (such as a
	table or column).

 System Status:
	The REPEAT or REPEATED specification will be ignored.
	Compilation will continue.

 Recommendation:
	If you want the query to be repeatable, use a literal in place of
	the variable reference.  If you want to retain the variable reference
	(thereby forcing the query to be marked non-repeatable), no action
	is necessary (but you might want to remove the REPEAT or REPEATED
	keyword so that the 4GL source file reflects what will actually occur,
	and so that subsequent compilations won't get the warning message).


E_OS015B_QualRepeat	"Warning: query is not repeatable.\n


 Explanation:
	The REPEAT (QUEL) or REPEATED (SQL) keyword was specified on a query.
	However, the query contains the QUALIFICATION function,
	which is not proper for a repeated query.

 System Status:
	The REPEAT or REPEATED specification will be ignored.
	Compilation will continue.

 Recommendation:
	If you want the query to be repeatable, remove the QUALIFICATION
	function.  If you want to retain the QUALIFICATION function
	(thereby forcing the query to be marked non-repeatable), no action
	is necessary (but you might want to remove the REPEAT or REPEATED
	keyword so that the 4GL source file reflects what will actually occur,
	and so that subsequent compilations won't get the warning message).


E_OS015C_BadColonInSelect	"Invalid use of colon in a SELECT target.\n


E_OS016D_NestedLocalProc	"A local procedure may not be declared


 Explanation:
	A local procedure may not be declared inside another local procedure.

 System Status:
	The statement will be processed, but the compilation will not succeed.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the declaration, or move it into the declarations
	for the main frame or procedure.


E_OS016E_NotInDisplayLoop	"The '%0c' statement is not allowed


 Explanation:
	The specified statement is not allowed within a 4GL procedure,
	nor is it allowed in a local procedure in a 4GL frame,
	unless it's inside a DISPLAY SUBMENU.

 System Status:
	The statement will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the statement or move it to the body of a 4GL frame,
	or move it inside a DISPLAY SUBMENU.


E_OS016F_InProcOrLocalProc	"The '%0c' statement is not allowed


 Explanation:
	The specified statement is not allowed within a 4GL procedure,
	nor is it allowed in a local procedure in a 4GL frame.

 System Status:
	The statement will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the statement or move it to the body of a 4GL frame.


E_OS0170	"Duplicate label definition.\n


 Explanation:
	The frame or 4GL procedure already has a label with the same name
	as the label that is being defined at this point.  Because this is
	ambiguous, you should use a different name for this label.

 System Status:
	The definition of this label will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Use a different name for the label.


E_OS0171	"Undefined label.\n


 Explanation:
	The label referenced in an ENDLOOP statement was not defined for any
	of the WHILE, UNLOADTABLE, or query loops active at this point in the
	source code.  Labels must be defined for an active loop at the point
	where they are referenced by an ENDLOOP statement.

 System Status:
	The ENDLOOP statement will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the name refers to a defined and active label, and then
	compile the source file.


E_OS0172	"The loop with label '%0c'


 Explanation:
	The label referenced in an ENDLOOP statement was defined for a WHILE,
	UNLOADTABLE, or query loop that is no longer active at this point in
	the source code.  Labels must be defined for an active loop at the point
	where they are referenced by an ENDLOOP statement.

 System Status:
	The ENDLOOP statement will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure the name refers to a defined and active label, and then
	compile the source file.


E_OS0173	"The '%0c' statement is not allowed


 Explanation:
	The specified statement is not allowed within a 4GL procedure.
	(It *is* allowed, however, in a local procedure in a 4GL frame).

 System Status:
	The statement will be ignored.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the statement or change the 4GL procedure to a frame.


 Explanation:
	Certain statements in 4GL implicitly assume that a form is associated
	with the object being compiled.  Since forms can never be associated
	with procedures, the presence of these statements in a procedure is
	recognized as an error.

 System Status:
	The statement will be ignored, and although the 4GL procedure will
	be checked for other errors, it will not be compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the unsupported statements from the procedure
	and then compile the source file for the procedure.


E_OS0175	"ENDLOOP can only be used within an unloadtable or


E_OS0176	"UNLOADTABLE statements cannot be nested."


E_OS0177	"Warning:  Hidden columns are not defined for table fields


E_OS0178	"Illegal character in text string.\n


 Explanation:
	The character '\0' was specified in a TEXT string constant in the
	source file being compiled.  Character strings of type TEXT cannot
	contain the character '\0' (the zero bit pattern.)  A more complete
	discussion of this can be found in the INGRES/SQL Reference Manual.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the character '\0' from the TEXT string constant and
	then compile the source file.


E_OS0179	"A qualification cannot appear in this statement."


E_OS017A	"Invalid field '%0c' in qualification.\n


 Explanation:
	The named hidden field was listed as a qualification predicate.  Since
	hidden fields are not known to the Forms System, they cannot contain
	both operators and values as can visible fields in query mode.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the hidden field from the qualification predicate.  (WHERE
	clauses can be built in a string variable to implement dynamic queries.
	Please consult the 4GL Reference Manual for details.)


E_OS0229	"Invalid column '%0c.%1c' in qualification.\n


 Explanation:
	The named hidden column was listed as a qualification predicate.  Since
	hidden columns are not known to the Forms System, they cannot contain
	both operators and values as can visible columns in query mode.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the hidden column from the qualification predicate.  (WHERE
	clauses can be built in a string variable to implement dynamic queries.
	Please consult the 4GL Reference Manual for details.)


E_OS017B	"Invalid field '%0c' in qualification.\n


 Explanation:
	The named 4GL variable (a table field, record, array, constant or global
	variable) was listed as a qualification predicate.  Since these data
	objects are not known to the Forms System, they cannot contain both
	operators and values as can visible fields in query mode, and hence,
	cannot be used in a qualification predicate.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the invalid field from the qualification predicate.  (WHERE
	clauses can be built in a string variable to implement dynamic queries.
	Please consult the 4GL Reference Manual for details.)


E_OS017C_SubmTooDeep	"Excessive nesting of submenus.\n


 Explanation:
	Submenus (defined by DISPLAY SUBMENU or RUN SUBMENU)
	may not be nested more than 30 levels deep.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Reduce the level of submenu nesting.


E_OS017D_BabSubmAct	"Invalid activation in RUN SUBMENU.\n


 Explanation:
	The specified activation (e.g. on a field or alerter event) is not 
	allowed directly inside a RUN SUBMENU.  (But it could appear inside
	a DISPLAY SUBMENU that's inside a RUN SUBMENU).

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the invalid activation from the list of activations
	for the RUN SUBMENU.


E_OS017E_BadResInAlert	"Invalid RESUME in an alerter activation.\n


 Explanation:
	Any RESUME directly inside an alerter activation must have no operands.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the RESUME or change it to a RESUME with no operands.


E_OS017F_MissingActs	"Missing activations.\n


 Explanation:
	A frame or submenu must have at least one non-alerter activation.
	The menu or submenu either has no activations at all
	(which probably means you have other syntax errors as well),
	or it has only an alerter event activation.

 System Status:
	The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
	compiled.

 Recommendation:
	Add an activation to the frame or submenu.

E_OS0223	"The statement REMOVE NODE is not supported in 4GL/QUEL."


E_OS0224	"SQL transaction syntax `%0c' has been modified.\nVersion 


 Explanation:
	This is a warning message that is produced when a 5.0 transaction
	statement is found in oslsql code in release 6.

 System Status:

 Recommendation:
	The user should modify their code to follow 6.0 sql transaction
	semantics or use the SET AUTOCOMMIT option to maintain 5.0 semantics.


E_OS0228	"Nullability clause not allowed for complex data types.\n


 Explanation:
	The named hidden field was declared with a NULL clause (WITH NULL
	or NOT NULL).  NULL clauses are not allowed on complex data types.
	(Complex objects are theoretically nullable, but there is no way to
	assign NULL to them, and there is no way to test for NULL.)

 System Status:
	This is a warning message.  The NULL clause will be ignored and
	compilation will continue.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the WITH NULL or NOT NULL clause from the declaration.


E_OS0250	"The undefined symbol `%0c' was referenced


E_OS0251	"`%0c' is not a record, array, or table field.\n

E_OS025A_BadFormRef	"Illegal form reference.\n


 Explanation:
	You do not need to qualify the data reference with the name of the
	form in this context.  That is, "form . id . id . . ." is illegal
	when referencing the data.

 System Action:
	4GL will not recognize the data reference in this case.

 Recommendation:
	Edit the 4GL source-code and remove the form name from the data
	reference.


E_OS025B_DatatypeUnsupp	"Warning: datatype encountered in a \"type of table\"


 Explanation:
	A "type of table" declaration encountered a column in the table that
	is of a datatype that 4GL doesn't recognize (e.g. long varchar).
	These columns will not be included in the declared record.  The rest
	of the columns in the table will be included in the record declaration.

 System Action:
	The compile will proceed.  Other compiler errors will result if the
	bad columns are referenced as members of this declared record.

 Recommendation:
	Create a record in ABF/VISION that has the desired attributes rather
	than basing on the DBMS table.


E_OS0260	"Record number required for array `%0c'.\n


E_OS0261	"Global `%0c' has non-existent datatype `%1c'.\n


E_OS0262	"Attribute `%0c' has non-existent datatype `%1c'.\n


E_OS0263	"Procedure `%0c' is undefined.\n


 Explanation:
	An undefined procedure was used inside an expression.  The compiler
	cannot generate code for the expression, because the undefined
	procedure's data type is unknown.

 System Action:
	4GL will not be able to compile the current frame or procedure.
	It will continue to look for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	If the procedure's name was misspelled, correct the spelling.  
	Otherwise, create it with the proper data type.


E_OS0264		"Do not specify row number for LOADTABLE.\n


 Explanation:
	LOADTABLE does not accept a row number, but one was specified.

 System Action:
	4GL will not be able to compile the current frame or procedure.
	It will continue to look for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the row number and recompile the frame.


E_OS0265		"LOADTABLE needs an assignment list\n


 Explanation:
	LOADTABLE requires at least one column assignment.

 System Action:
	4GL will not be able to compile the current frame or procedure.
	It will continue to look for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Add a column assignment to the LOADTABLE statement and recompile.


E_OS0266_ProcInVar	"Procedure name is specified via a variable.\n


 Explanation:
	A procedure whose name was specified in a string variable
	was used inside an expression.  The compiler cannot generate code
	for the expression, because the procedure's data type is unknown.

 System Action:
	4GL will not be able to compile the current frame or procedure.
	It will continue to look for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Assign the result of the procedure call to a variable whose type
	is compatible with all possible procedure names.  Then use
	the variable instead of the procedure call in the expression.
	For example:  Suppose the logic of your application ensures
	that the variable PROCNAME (of type VARCHAR(8)) may contain
	either 'proc1' or 'proc2'.  Suppose proc1 returns a result
	of type SMALLINT and proc2 returns a result of type INTEGER.
	Suppose both proc1 and proc2 take a single integer argument PARM.
	Suppose i, j, and k are integer variables.
	Then instead of coding
		i = j + :procname(parm=k);
	code
		i = :procname(parm=k);
		i = j + i;


E_OS0267_CallProcSysFunc	"CALLPROC must not specify a system function.\n


 Explanation:
	CALLPROC must not specify a system function.

 System Action:
	4GL will not be able to compile the current frame or procedure.
	It will continue to look for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Remove the keyword CALLPROC: code 

		result = system_func(...)

	instead of

		result = CALLPROC system_func(...)

	Alternatively, if you intended to override the system function
	with a procedure of your own, create the procedure.
	(Even if it's written in a 3GL, you must create an entry for it
	in the ABF catalog).


E_OS0268_BadTblFld	"A table field is invalid in this context.\n


 Explanation:
	A table field was detected in an illegal context, such as on the
	right hand side of a positional parameter in a callproc or callframe
	statement.

 System Status:
	4GL will not be able to compile the current frame or procedure.
	It will continue to look for other errors.

 Recommendation:
	Correct this illegal table field reference.


E_OS0269_BadDbmsinfo	"Warning: invalid use of DBMSINFO\n


 Explanation:
	DBMSINFO is intended for use only inside a DBMS statement.

 System Status:
	The 4GL compilation will continue.

 Recommendation:
	In general, place the invocation of DBMSINFO inside a SELECT.
	For example, if v is a VARCHAR variable, code

		SELECT v = DBMSINFO('username');

	instead of

		v = DBMSINFO('username');

	One possible exception is DBMSINFO('_bintim').  Outside a DBMS
	statement, this has, in prior releases, returned the current time
	on the machine which is running your application, expressed as
	the number of seconds elapsed since Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 G.M.T.
	(This has never been a supported feature).  If you code

		SELECT v = DBMSINFO('_bintim');

	you'll get the current time on the DBMS server machine,
	which may be different from the current time on the machine
	which is running your application.  To get the latter time, code

		v = VARCHAR(INT4(INTERVAL('sec', 'now' -
			DATE('1970.01.01 00:00:00 gmt'))));


E_OS0270_NoPurgeTableName


 Explanation:
	A syntax error.  The user did not specify a table field name
	for the purgetable statement.  User must supply at least the
	name of a table field.

 System Status:
      The source file will be checked for other errors but will not be
      compiled.

 Recommendation:
	The source code must be changed to provide a table field name.

	An object key may not be joined to a column that's not an object key.

 System Status:
	An error is displayed, and the cursor is then positioned
	on the offending pair of join columns.

 Recommendation:
	The user should clear or correct the pair of join columns.


E_QF0167_bad_table_key_join


 Explanation:
	A table key may not be joined to a column that's not a table key.

 System Status:
	An error is displayed, and the cursor is then positioned
	on the offending pair of join columns.

 Recommendation:
	The user should clear or correct the pair of join columns.


E_QF0168_system_system_join


 Explanation:
	A system-maintained logical key may not be joined to another
	system-maintained logical key, either directly or indirectly.
	(An indirect join is a chain of explicit joins).
	A system-maintained logical key may be joined only
	to a user-maintained logical key.
	Note that a default joindef will never directly join
	two system-maintained logical keys, even if they have the same
	column name, but it may try to join two system-maintained
	logical keys indirectly if they have the same name
	and there's also a user-maintained logical key with same name.

 System Status:
	An error is displayed, and, if the join is direct,
	the cursor is then positioned on the offending pair of join columns.

 Recommendation:
	The user should clear or correct the pair of join columns.
	If the error occurs on the Tables screen (in a default joindef),
	you must select the Joins menuitem; once there, you should remove
	one of the explicit joins that's part of the offending indirect join.


E_QF0169_user_system_MD_join


 Explanation:
	A system-maintained logical key in a detail table may not be joined
	to anything in a master table, either directly or indirectly.
	Note that a default joindef will never directly join
	a detail system-maintained logical key to a master
	user-maintained logical key, even if they have the same
	column name, but it may try to join two such
	logical keys indirectly if they have the same name
	and there's also a detail user-maintained logical key with same name.

 System Status:
	An error is displayed, and, if the join is direct (explicit),
	the cursor is then positioned on the offending pair of join columns.

 Recommendation:
	The user should clear or correct the pair of join columns.
	If the error occurs on the Tables screen (in a default joindef),
	you must select the Joins menuitem; once there, you should remove
	one of the explicit joins that's part of the offending indirect join.


E_QF0170_DD_system_user_append


 Explanation:
	If the join specification includes a detail-detail join
	on a system-maintained logical key and a user-maintained logical key,
	appends of a detail are not supported.
	This restriction may be removed in a future release.

 System Status:
	Control remains on the Update screen.

 Recommendation:
	If the join is changed to be a master-detail join
	(on the system-maintained logical key
	and the user-maintained logical key),
	masters can be added by doing an append and
	details can be added by doing an update
	(selecting 'Update' from the Execution Phase screen).


E_QF0171_MM_system_user_append


 Explanation:
	If the join specification includes a master-master join
	on a system-maintained logical key and a user-maintained logical key,
	appends of a master are not supported.
	This restriction may be removed in a future release.

 System Status:
	Control remains on the Execution Phase screen.

 Recommendation:
	If the join is changed to be a master-detail join
	(on the system-maintained logical key
	and the user-maintained logical key),
	masters can be added by doing an append and
	details can be added by doing an update
	(selecting 'Update' from the Execution Phase screen).


E_QF0172_lkey_lkey_join


 Explanation:
	A logical key may not be joined to another logical key.
	This restriction may be removed in a future release.

 System Status:
	An error message is displayed, and, if the error was detected
	on the JoinDef Joins screen, the cursor is then positioned
	on the offending pair of join columns.

 Recommendation:
	The user should clear or correct the pair of join columns.
	If the error occurs on the Tables screen (in a default joindef),
	you should select the Joins menuitem and remove the offending join.
	If the error occurs when you attempt to run an old joindef with a join
	on a logical key (created with a release of QBF prior to 6.3/03),
	you should destroy the JoinDef and create a new one without
	the offending join.


E_QF0173_BadArgument


E_QF0174_R_FlagSyntax


 Explanation:
      The user tried to specify a role and password when running QBF, by
      using the illegal syntax "-R<role_id>/<passwd>".

 System Status:
      QBF will exit after issuing this error message.

 Recommendation:
      Specify the role, using "-R<role_id>", then wait to be prompted for a
      password.


E_QF0175_BadTable


 Explanation:
	An error occurred in the target DBMS when it tried to determine
	if a table exists.  The target DBMS may be a gateway; there may be
	something about the table name which is invalid for that gateway.
	For example, DB2 requires that table names be no more than 19
	characters long.  A previous popup message may give more details
	about the error.

 System Status:
	The table name is not accepted.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure you are specifying a table name that's valid for the DBMS
	you are running QBF against.  If the error persists, you may need
	to contact your system administrator.


E_QF0176_Not_supported_type  "Unsupported Datatype Detected\n


 Explanation:

 System Status:

 Recommendation:


E_QF0177_UnDataType


 Explanation:  Appends are not allowed on tables with unsupported
		 datatypes (BLOBs) if a value must be supplied (NOT
		 NULL and no defined DEFAULT).  The APPEND function
		 was specified.

 System Status: Returns from query execution module

 Recommendation:  Exit QBF, define a default for the column(s), return to QBF


E_QF0178_AppUnDataType


 Explanation:  Appends are not allowed on tables with unsupported
		 datatypes (BLOBs) if a value must be supplied (NOT
		 NULL and no defined DEFAULT).  The UPDATE function was
		 specified, and there are currently no rows to work with.
		 Thus, APPEND is the only valid option, and it is disallowed.

 System Status: Returns from query execution module

 Recommendation:  Exit QBF, define a default for the column(s), return to QBF
		 -OR- redefine the query such that rows are returned.


E_QF0179_AllUnDataType


 Explanation:  No eligible columns exist in the query, and so no
		 processing can occur.

 System Status: Returns from query execution module

 Recommendation:  Redefine the query to contain at least one eligible
		 column (if possible).


E_QF0180_NoAppAllowed


 Explanation:  Appends are not allowed on tables with unsupported
		 datatypes (BLOBs) if a value must be supplied (NOT
		 NULL and no defined DEFAULT).  The UPDATE function was
		 specified.

 System Status: Execution continues.

 Recommendation:  Understand the limitation of what you're doing!


E_QF0181_InvalidName


 Explanation:  A table specification is invalid (owner and/or name portion),
		 a QBFname or Joindef specification is not a valid FE name,
		 or a QBFname or Joindef was specified as an owner.object
		 construct (determined by specification of -j/-f flag).
		 The second field is retrieved from E_QF0182_TLit,
		 E_QF0183_JLit, or E_QF0184_QLit.

 System Status: Execution stops.

 Recommendation:  Ensure that the object type is correct if an owner is
		 specified.  Otherwise correct the probable typo.


E_QF0182_TLit


E_QF0183_JLit


E_QF0184_QLit


E_QF0185_OLit


 Explanation:  A name specification on lookup had an owner component or was
		 determined to be a delimited identifier.  These constructs
		 are only valid for table names, and so the name search will
		 be limited to that object type.

 System Status: Nothing. This is just a warning ...

 Recommendation:  Ensure that you only want a table.  Otherwise correct the
		 probable typo.


E_QF0187_BadOwnName	"Invalid table name.\n


 Explanation:  A table name specification's owner component was determined
		 to be a bogus identifier.

 System Status: Force respecification of the offending table name.

 Recommendation:  Correct the probable typo.


E_QG0001_No_Internal	"Internal program error:  Missing data structures.\n


 Explanation:
	The query generator module was called to break out of a query
	for which no internal data structure had been set-up.  This is
	an internal programming problem.

 System Status:
	No action.

 Recommendation:
	Report this internal problem to your technical representative.


E_QG0002_NoStart	"Internal program error:  No QG_START operation.\n


 Explanation:
	The query generator module was called to fetch a row without a query
	having been started.  The query generator module should be called to
	start a query before calling it to fetch a row.  This is an internal
	programming problem.

 System Status:
	No rows will be fetched.

 Recommendation:
	Report this internal problem to your technical representative.


E_QG0003_NoMemory	"Internal program error:  Memory allocation failure.\n


 Explanation:
	The query generator module attempted to allocate some memory needed to
	execute a query or fetch the data for a query, but could not.  This is
	an internal programming problem.

 System Status:
	The query will not be executed or no data will be fetched for the query.

 Recommendation:
	Report this internal problem to your technical representative.


E_QG0004_NoSpec		"Internal program warning:\n


 Explanation:
	A function that the query generator module called to build a dynamic
	query specification did not generate a query specification.  This is
	usually not an error, but if you see the error message this is because
	of an internal programming error.

 System Status:
	An always true predicate will be generated, "1=1".

 Recommendation:
	Report this internal problem to your technical representative.


E_QG0005_BadVersion	"Internal program error:  Incompatible versions.\n


 Explanation:
	The query generator module detected a version incompatibility in its
	usage.  In particular, a version 0 query with '%a' format (meaning
	DBDV data type) in its parameter list was passed to the QG module.
	Queries with DBDV elements should be version 1, only.  This is an
	internal programming problem.

 System Status:
	The query will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
	Report this internal problem to your technical representative.


E_QG0006_BadSpec	"Internal program error:  Bad query specification.\n


 Explanation:
	The query generator module detected an invalid query specification in

	problem.

 System Status:
	The query will not be executed.

 Recommendation:
	Report this internal problem to your technical representative.


E_QG0010_TempFile	"Could not open temporary file.\n


 Explanation:
	The query generator module could not open a temporary file used to hold
	data fetched for the query being executed.  This could be for any number
	of reasons, but is most likely a disk space or access problem.

 System Status:
	No data will be fetched for the query.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that the you have access rights to the temporary directory and
	sufficient disk space before reporting this internal problem to your
	technical representative.


E_QG0011_WriteFile	"Could not write to temporary file.\n


 Explanation:
	The query generator module could not write to a temporary file used to
	hold data fetched for the query being executed.  This could be for any
	number of reasons, but is most likely a disk space problem.

 System Status:
	Query execution will be terminated with an error status.

 Recommendation:
	Make sure that the you have access rights to the temporary directory and
	sufficient disk space before reporting this internal problem to your
	technical representative.


E_QG0012_Unsupported	"Unsupported Select syntax in Windows4GL.\n


 Explanation:
	The query generator module was asked to perform executions that have
	been removed for Windows4GL.

 System Status:
	Query execution will be terminated with an error status.

 Explanation:
	These strings together comprise most of the per-column
	title line for help output on a table.
	Warning for translators:  The code as currently written,
	not just the above seven strings, is very length specific.
	That is, the translation for F_QR005D must be less than 9 chars,
	that for F_QR005E be less than 7 chars, that for F_QR005F
	be 5 chars (may include spaces), that for F_QR0060 be 8 chars
	(may include spaces), and that for F_QR0061 be 3 chars.
	These restrictions are because the 'help table' output needs
	to line up, and there is absolutely no more space available
	on an 80 column terminal (when including the additional space
	required for F_QR0038/F_QR003A.)

 System Status:
	Nothing special.

 Recommendation:
	None.


 Explanation:
	These strings together comprise most of the per-secondary index
	title line for help output on a table.
	Warning for translators:  The code as currently written,
	not just the above three strings, is length specific.
	That is, the translation for F_QR0063 must be less than or equal
	to 10 chars.  This restriction is because the output needs
	to line up.

 System Status:
	Nothing special.

 Recommendation:
	None.


 Explanation:
	The above strings, used in qrviphlp and qrtblhlp, give information
	on permissions when user is running SQL instead of QUEL.

E_RW1417_BadDecimal	"A bad value was given in II_APP_DECIMAL.\n


 Explanation:
	The character given in II_APP_DECIMAL is not a valid decimal point
	character.  This is the character you have used in RW source
	statements to specify numeric literals that can have a fractional part,
	such as money values or real numbers.  Valid decimal point characters
	are `.' or `,'.  Important note: this logical symbol is provided
	only for backward compatibility.  It is recommended that you use
	a decimal point character of `.' in your RW source code,
	and leave II_APP_DECIMAL unset (it will default to `.'),
	or the (valid) value in II_DECIMAL.

 System Status:
	The ReportWriter will assume that your statements will use
	a decimal point character of `.' to specify the fractional parts
	of numeric literals.  If your statements in fact use some other
	character, a syntax error will be reported.

 Recommendation:
	Set a valid single-character string for the II_APP_DECIMAL name.


E_RW1418_	"An incorrect value was passed for flag 'numeric_overflow'.\n


 Explanation:
 An incorrect value was passed for flag 'numeric_overflow'.

	was not possible to recover from the error.  This may
	indicate a bug, or a limitation which we would like to
	know about.

 System Status:
	The program will abort.

 Recommendation:
	You should restart the program and try the operation again.
	If it still fails, call your INGRES support person.


E_UG000A_No_Form_File	"Could not find form index file, `%0c'.\n


 Explanation:
	INGRES front-ends read the forms that they will use from a special
	file that contains all the INGRES forms.  A separate file exists for
	each ethnic language that INGRES supports.  The file for the current
	language and installation could not be found.  This is either because
	it does not exist for the language specified through II_LANGUAGE
	("$II_CONFIG/$II_LANGUAGE/rtiforms.fnx",) or the pathname specified
	through II_FORMFILE is incorrect.  This is most likely because the
	installation is incorrect.

 System Status:
	No forms will be initialized.  The program will terminate.

 Recommendation:
	Determine that the language installation is correct, and re-install
	if necessary.  Or, if II_FORMFILE was specified make sure that it
	specifies a valid pathname.


E_UG000B_ExitsLimit	"FEset_exit:  too many module exits.\n

 Explanation:
	A valid INGRES name must be entered as described in the message.
	Examples of valid INGRES names are "_123", "_$name", or "name1".
	Some invalid names are "%xyz", "$name", or "1left".

 System Status:
	The program will not accept the name until you enter a valid INGRES
	name (or in some cases, no value.)

 Recommendation:
	Enter a valid INGRES name.


E_UG000F_NoDBconnect	"Error connecting to database `%0c'."


 Explanation:
	The program could not successfully connect to the named database
	most likely because the database does not exist, or possibly because
	the commands specified using the ING_SET environment logical are
	incorrect.

	Occasionally, successful database connection may be precluded by
	other errors (e.g., GCA errors, etc.) usually evidence of some sort
	of installation problem or hardware or system failure.

 System Status:
	The program will not start up.

 Recommendation:
	Check that the database name was specified correctly and re-enter
	the command line.  Also, check that the commands specified using
	the ING_SET logical are correct.

 Explanation:
	INGRES sub-systems called through the OSL "call <sub-system> ..." or the
	EQL "call <sub-system> (database = ... )" statements share the calling
	application's DBMS session.  Since INGRES sub-systems have their own
	transaction semantics (partly to avoid locking system tables,) it is a
	mistake to call one while a transaction is still active on the DBMS
	session.

 System Status:
	The open transaction will be committed and any open cursors closed.

 Recommendation:
	Commit all transactions before calling any INGRES sub-system.

	code indicated that "upgradefe" did not work properly.

 System Status:
	A fatal error will be issued. The program does not start.

 Recommendation:
	Run "upgradefe" for the dictionary mentioned in the error message. 
	See your INGRES/SQL reference manual for information on how to run
	"upgradefe" from the command line.


E_UI002F_MODULE_FILE_MISSING	"Error occurred creating front-end dictionary\n


 Explanation:
	Upgradefe read a row from a .cli file that identified a
	front-end dictionary module and version. However, the .cre
	file for that module could not be found. The .cre file
	gives the SQL statements required to create the module.

 System Status:
	The front-end dictionary is not created or converted. Upgradefe

 Explanation:
      The front-end program has just checked if the correct versions
      of the front-end catalogs it requires are present in this database,
      and some are missing. Furthermore, this user is not the DBA, and
      thus is not authorized to add the missing catalogs to the database.
      Probably this is the first time anyone has tried to run this front-end
      program on this database.

 System Status:
      The database is untouched. It is as if the front-end program never
      attempted to connect to this database.

 Recommendation:
      Contact the database administrator for this database and have them
      run the command described in the error text.


E_UI0029_UPGRADE_DBA	"Cannot start program; must upgrade catalogs\n


 Explanation:
      The front-end program has just checked if the correct versions
      of the front-end catalogs it requires are present in this database,
      and some are not of the correct version.

      Probably you are trying to run a newer front-end program against an
      older database, that has a different version of the catalogs this
      front-end program requires.

 System Status:
      The database is untouched. It is as if the front-end program never
      attempted to connect to this database.

 Recommendation:
      Upgrade the front-end catalogs in the database by running the
      command described in the error text.


E_UI002A_UPGRADE_NOTDBA	"Cannot start program; DBA must upgrade catalogs\n


 Explanation:
      The front-end program has just checked if the correct versions
      of the front-end catalogs it requires are present in this database,
      and some are not of the correct version. Furthermore, you are not
      the DBA for this database and so you cannot upgrade its front-end
      catalogs.

      Probably you are trying to run a newer front-end program against an
      older database, that has a different version of the catalogs this
      front-end program requires.

 System Status:
      The database is untouched. It is as if the front-end program never
      attempted to connect to this database.

 Recommendation:
      Ask the DBA to upgrade the front-end catalogs in the database by
      running the command described in the error text.


E_UI002B_CANNOT_UPGRADE	"Cannot start program; Incompatible catalogs\n


 Explanation:
      The front-end program has just checked if the correct versions
      of the front-end catalogs it requires are present in this database,
      and some are not of the correct version. Furthermore, the catalogs
      in this database cannot be converted to make them compatible with
      this front-end program. Probably you are running an older front-end
      program against a newer database, which has front-end catalogs
      that are not compatible with this front-end program.

 System Status:
      The database is untouched. It is as if the front-end program never
      attempted to connect to this database.

 Recommendation:
      You must acquire a newer version of this front-end program (one that
      is compatible with the database you are trying to connect to). Usually
      this is accomplished by installing a new version of INGRES.


E_UI002C_CHECKDICT_ERR	"Cannot start program; Error checking catalogs\n


 Explanation:
      The front-end program has just tried to check if the correct versions
      of the front-end catalogs it requires are present in this database.

      During that process, it reads several files in the "dictfiles"
      subdirectory of the "files" subdirectory of the "ingres" directory.
      It also issues queries against the "ii_dict_modules" and
      "ii_client_dep_mod" catalogs in your database.

      An unexpected error occurred while reading these files or while
      querying these tables in your database.

 System Status:
      The database is untouched. It is as if the front-end program never
      attempted to connect to this database.

 Recommendation:
      First try to run "upgradefe -b" on this database. If that fails, then
      check:
              - That the catalogs "ii_dict_modules" and "ii_client_dep_mod"
              both exist in the database.

              - For the existence of the subdirectories of the "ingres"
              directory mentioned above. Make sure you have read access
              to that directory.

              - Is the environment variable II_DICTFILES (an unsupported
              environment variable) set? If set, it should point to
              a directory that contains ALL the files normally found in the
              subdirectory of the "ingres" directory mentioned above. Also,
              you must have read access to that directory.


E_UI0036_NO_SUCH_CLIENT	"Cannot start program; unknown product specified.\n


 Explanation:
	The product and version specified by the front-end program is not
	installed in this dictionary, and the installation does not contain
	the files necessary to install it. Something is inconsistent
	with this installation compared to this front-end program.

 System Status:
	The front-end program will not be allowed to start.

 Recommendation:
	Check your installation. Particularly the dates, etc, on the
	front-end program you tried to run, and check that against the
	*.cli files in the 'dictfiles' subdirectory of the ingres
	'files' directory.

	The first line of each *.cli file identifies which product and
	version the file describes. There is not one for the product
	and version listed in the error message.


E_UI0037_NO_SYSTEM_OWNER "Unable to find owner of INGRES catalogs.\n


 Explanation:
	The program tried to select iitables.table_owner for the system
	table described in the message (probably catalog "ii_objects") and
	either no rows were selected, or an error occurred.

	It should only be possible for this error to happen on an
	INGRES/Gateway, which has 6.3 or older standard catalogs and
	NO front-end catalogs. 

 System Status:
	Program cannot run without this information and must exit.
	The front-end program will not be allowed to start.

 Recommendation:
	Check that this database has the INGRES system catalog listed
	in the error message. Contact your INGRES Technical Contact for
	assistance. If the INGRES front-end system catalogs cannot be
	created, then the standard catalogs must be upgraded to 6.4 level
	or higher.
