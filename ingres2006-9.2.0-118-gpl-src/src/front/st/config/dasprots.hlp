  This form can be used to modify listen address information or enable
  specific protocols for the selected Ingres Data Access Server definition.

  For an Ingres Data Access Server to use a supported protocol, it must
  have a valid listen address assigned to it which is unique with respect to
  the listen addresses assigned to other Ingres Data Access Servers for the
  same protocol.

  Refer to the Ingres Connectivity Guide for details on the syntax of
  Ingres/Data Access Server listen addresses for specific protocols.
