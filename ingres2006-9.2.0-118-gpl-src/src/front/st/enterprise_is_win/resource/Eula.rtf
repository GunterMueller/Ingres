\pard\qj\kerning0\b0\f1\fs20 PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY.  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE ("LICENSE"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE. \par
\f0\par
\pard\qc\b\f1 License Background\par
\pard\qj\b0\f0\par
\f1 Computer Associates International, Inc. (\ldblquote CA\rdblquote ) believes in open source.  We believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and innovation.  To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.  \par
\par
This License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses.  Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License unless you choose to do so.  Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms of this License.  \par
\par
The provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program.  \par
\pard\s3\sb100\sa100\qj\b\f0\fs24 1.\tab DEFINITIONS \par
\pard\fi-720\li720\qj\b0 1.1\tab\ldblquote Contribution\rdblquote  means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and (b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution \ldblquote originates\rdblquote  from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor\rquote s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program. \par
\pard\qj\par
\pard\fi-720\li720\qj 1.2\tab\ldblquote Contributor\rdblquote  means CA and any other person or entity that distributes the Program. \par
\pard\qj\par
\pard\fi-720\li720\qj 1.3\tab\ldblquote Contributor Version\rdblquote  means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the Contributor\rquote s Contribution but not any Contributions made to the Program thereafter.\par
\pard\qj\par
\pard\fi-720\li720\qj 1.4\tab\ldblquote Larger Work\rdblquote  means a work that combines the Program or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\par

\pard\s3\sb100\sa100\qj\b 2.\tab GRANT OF RIGHTS \par
\pard\fi-720\li720\sb100\sa100\qj\b0 2.1\tab Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.  For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.\par
2.2\tab Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such combination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of Contributions made by that Contributor.\par
2.3\tab Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. \par
2.4\tab Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License. \par
\pard\s3\sb100\sa100\qj\b 3.\tab DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS \par
\pard\fi-720\li720\qj\b0\f1\fs20 3.1\tab\f0\fs24 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the source code.  \f1\fs20 A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100\qj\tx720\f0\fs24 a.\tab it complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa240\qj\tx720 b.\tab its license agreement: \par
\pard\fi-720\li2160\sb100\qj\tx2160 i.\tab effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law; \par
ii.\tab effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law; \par
iii.\tab states that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and \par
iv.\tab states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner. \par
\pard\qj\fs20\par
\f1 3.2\tab When the Program is made available in source code form: \i\f0\par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100\qj\tx720\i0\fs24 a.\tab it must be made available under this License; and \par
b.\tab a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program. \par
\pard\fi-720\li720\qj 3.3\tab This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of the Program by any Contributor.  However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program.  Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipient\rquote s exercise of its rights under this License to the Program.  Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work.  It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.\par
\par
3.4\tab A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program.  Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on such Contributor\rquote s behalf.  No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\ldblquote Commercial Contributor\rdblquote ) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\ldblquote Indemnified Contributor\rdblquote ) who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \ldblquote Losses\rdblquote ) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\fs20\par
\pard\qj\fs24\par
\pard\fi-720\li720\qj 3.5\tab If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party\rquote s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled \ldblquote ../IP_ISSUES\rdblquote , and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com,\b  \b0 both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained.\par
\pard\qj\par
\pard\fi-720\li720\qj\f1\fs20 3.6\tab Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any documentation.  \f0\fs24 In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. \par
\pard\s3\sb100\sa100\qj\b 4.\tab CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS\par
\pard\fi-720\li720\qj\b0 4.1\tab Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of any change.  Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or ownership of the Program.\par

\pard\s3\sb100\sa100\qj\b 9.\tab OWNERSHIP\par
\pard\fi-720\li720\qj\b0 9.1\tab Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (\ldblquote CA Contributions\rdblquote ), and such CA Contributions will not be automatically subject to this License.
