\par }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 Preamble
\par The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software}{\insrsid5655971 \emdash }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 to}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public}{
\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free}{
\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.}{\insrsid7236309 

\par }{\insrsid5655971\charrsid8545851 
\par }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you}{\insrsid5655971  }{
\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it}{\insrsid5655971  }{
\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
\par 
\par To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.}{\insrsid5655971   }{\insrsid7236309 
\par }{\insrsid5655971\charrsid8545851 
\par }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You}{\insrsid5655971  }{
\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
\par 
\par We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
distribute and/or modify the software.}{\insrsid7236309 
\par }{\insrsid5655971\charrsid8545851 
\par }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free}{\insrsid5655971  }{
\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,}{\insrsid5655971  }{
\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 authors' reputations.
\par 
\par Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
\par 
\par The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
\par modification follow.}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309 
\par }{\insrsid5655971\charrsid8545851 
\par }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION}{\insrsid5655971  
\par }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed}{\insrsid5655971  }{
\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"}{\insrsid5655971  }{
\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,}{\insrsid5655971  }{
\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in}{\insrsid5655971  }{
\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
\par 
\par Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 on what the Program does.
\par 
\par 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
\par 
\par 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 that you also meet all of these conditions:
\par 
\par     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
\par     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 terms of this License.
\par     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 e
lse, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
\par 
\par These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
\par 
\par Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 based on the Program.}{\insrsid7236309 
\par }{\insrsid5655971\charrsid8545851 
\par }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a}{\insrsid5655971  }{
\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 scope of this License.
\par 
\par 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
\par     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,}{\insrsid5655971 
\par }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically}{\insrsid5655971  }{
\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,}{\insrsid5655971 
\par   }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851   c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only}{\insrsid5655971  }{
\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
\par 
\par The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception,}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 source along with the object code.
\par 
\par 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
full compliance.
\par 
\par 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 distributin
g the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
\par 
\par 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
\par 
\par 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 distribution of the Program.
\par 
\par If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
\par 
\par This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
\par 
\par 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
written in the body of this License.
\par 
\par 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 to address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
the Free Software Foundation.
\par 
\par 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
\par 
\par NO WARRANTY
\par 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF}{\insrsid5655971   }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\par 
\par 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 LOSSE
S SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY}{\insrsid5655971  }{\insrsid7236309\charrsid8545851 
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
