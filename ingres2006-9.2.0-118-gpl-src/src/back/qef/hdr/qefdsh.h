/**
** Name: QEFDSH.H - Data segment header
**
** Description:
**      The data segment header (DSH) contains the queries runtime
**  environment and a pointer to the query plan (QP).
**
** History: $Log-for RCS$
**      24-mar-86 (daved)
**          written
**	22-oct-87 (puree)
**	    query constant support.
**	11-mar-88 (puree)
**	    remove DSH_QUEUE structure. DMT_CB's can be linked together
**	    using the standard jupiter control block header.
**	31-aug-88 (carl)
**	    added structure QEE_DDB_CB and field dsh_ddb_cb in QEE_DSH
**	19-sep-88 (puree)
**	    remove QEN_STAT. Use QEN_STATUS instead.
**	    move QEN_HOLD FROM QEFNODE.H here.
**	24-dec-88 (carl)
**	    added new fields to QEE_DDB_CB
**	01-jan-89 (carl)
**	    modified QEE_DDB_CB
**	15-jan-89 (paul)
**	    Add QEE_ACTCTX to contain context for nested action lists.
**	    Add DSH structures for nested actions and nested procedures.
**	14-feb-89 (carl)
**	    added new fields to QEE_DDB_CB
**	22-feb-89 (carl)
**	    added new fields to QEE_DDB_CB
**	31-mar-89 (carl)
**	    added qee_d10_tupdesc_p and qee_d11_ldb_desc to QEE_DDB_CB
**	01-apr-89 (paul)
**	    Add status flag to dsh_qp_status. It is now possible for the
**	    system to try to invoke the same QP in a nested fashion requiring
**	    multiple DSH's for the QP. We need to indicate that a DSH is in use.
**	07-apr-89 (carl)
**	    added qee_d12_ldb_rowcnt to QEE_DDB_CB
**	08-may-89 (carl)
**	    added define QEE_06Q_TDS to QEE_DDB_CB
**      28-jul-89 (jennifer)
**          Added status value to dsh_qp_status.  It indicates that
**          the audit inforamtion has been processed for this QP.
**	04-apr-90 (davebf)
**	    overloaded shd_dups
**	04-apr-90 (davebf)   
**	    added hold_medium, unget_status, unget_buffer
**	17-apr-90 (davebf)
**	    added shd_options
**	20-nov-90 (davebf)
**	    Add DSH_CURSOR_OPEN to dsh_qp_status.  Set in qeq_open. Tested
**	    in qea_fetch when no QEP.
**	28-dec_90 (davebf)
**	    added hold_reset_pending, hold_reset_counter, hold_inner_status. 
**	24-jan-91 (davebf)
**	    added dsh_shd_cnt to qee_dsh.
**	27-mar-92 (rickh)
**	    Removed overloading of shd_dups.  For tid hold files, added new
**	    field:  shd_tid.  Added new status word to qen_hold structure
**	    to describe states needed by right fsmjoins.
**	05-may-92 (rickh)
**	    Defined new flags for qen_status.node_access for use with
**	    fsmjoins.
**	10-aug-1992 (rickh)
**	    Added QEE_TEMP_TABLE.
**	28-oct-92 (rickh)
**	    Replaced references to ADT_CMP_LIST with DB_CMP_LIST.
**	30-nov-92 (anitap)
**	    Added pointers to QEF_RCB & QEE_DSH structures in QEE_DSH.
**	02-apr-93 (jhahn)
**	    Added DSH_CT_CONTINUE2 to QEE_ACTCTX for support of statement
**	    level unique indexes.
**	07-jul-93 (anitap)
**	    Added defines for flag used in qea_schema() to differentiate
**	    between explicit and implicit creation of schemas.
**      20-jul-1993 (pearl)
**          Bug 45912.  Add dsh_kor_nor, array of pointers to QEN_NOR's, to
**          QEE_DSH.
**          Changed name of this file from DSH.H to its real name, QEFDSH.H.
**	5-oct-93 (eric)
**	    Added support for resource lists.
**	18-oct-1993 (rickh)
**	    Changed the states in the node_access field to be flags. This is
**	    the first step toward converting KEY and TID JOIN interpreters
**	    into the same model used by FSM, PSM, and CP.  Added a new flag for
**	    KEY JOINS: this flag indicates whether the last outer tuple
**	    managed to key into the inner relation.
**	13-jan-94 (rickh)
**	    Reduced _QEE_VALID to a struct.  As a typedef it generated
**	    acc compiler warnings.
**	18-may-95 (ramra01)
**	    Added a field in the QEN_SHD to handle sort max for the new sort
**	    implementation.
**      14-may-97 (dilma04)
**          Cursor Stability Project:
**          Add DSH_SORT flag to QEE_DSH.
**	06-jul-1998 (somsa01)
**	    Added dsh_dgtt_cb_no to QEE_DSH, to keep track of the global
**	    temporary table in a "declare global temporary table ... as
**	    select ..." situation.  (Bug #91827)
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	21-sep-2000 (hanch04)
**	    fix bad cross integration
**	01-oct-2001 (devjo01)
**	    Renamed QEN_HASH_DUP to QEF_HASH_DUP and moved it from qefdsh.h 
**	    to qefmain.h so that it will be visible to the OPC functions 
**	    which compile the code used to manipulate it.
**	20-nov-03 (inkdo01)
**	    #defines to distinguish opens to qen_func's at root node,
**	    not at root and already open (for parallel query processing).
**	17-mar-04 (toumi01)
**	    add FUNC_CLOSE for exchange processing
**	8-apr-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Added QEF_CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPT macro (copied from back!hdr!
**	    qefcb.h because it now refs QEE_DSH).
**      12-Apr-2004 (stial01)
**          Define dsh_length as SIZE_TYPE.

** Name: QEN_STATUS  - status block for QEF processing nodes
**
** Description:
**      The QEN_STATUS structure is used to contain the runtime
**      status for a processing node. The information in here
**      changes on a per row basis.
**
**	All QEN_STATUS blocks are cleared en masse at the start of
**	query execution in qee.
**
** History:
**	19-sep-88 (puree)
**	    Adopted from QEN_STAT with the following fields renamed:
**		stat_status	->  node_status
**		stat_unget	removed, use hold_buffer_status
**		stat_indone     ->  node_inner_status
**		stat_ptr	->  node_ahd_ptr
**		stat_rcount	->  node_rcount
**	04-apr-90 (davebf)
**	    added node_access, node_outer_status, node_hold_stream 
**	05-may-92 (rickh)
**	    Defined new flags for qen_status.node_access for use with
**	    fsmjoins.
**	18-oct-1993 (rickh)
**	    Changed the states in the node_access field to be flags. This is
**	    the first step toward converting KEY and TID JOIN interpreters
**	    into the same model used by FSM, PSM, and CP.  Added a new flag for
**	    KEY JOINS: this flag indicates whether the last outer tuple
**	    managed to key into the inner relation.
**	23-jul-98 (inkdo01)
**	    Added QEN_READ_PREV flag to node_access for topsort-less 
**	    descending sort.
**	2-mar-99 (inkdo01)
**	    Added flags for hash joins (QEN13_PROBE_P1, QEN14_PROBE_P2).
**	20-nov-03 (inkdo01)
**	    Added node_open_status for parallel query processing.
**	2-jan-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Changed node_open_status to node_status_flags to allow bit
**	    flags rather than one value at a time (what a crock!). Added
**	    node_part_xxx's to track partition numbers in qen_orig().
**	    Finally, union'ed some of the elements to cap structure size.
**	17-mar-04 (toumi01)
**	    add QEN8_NODE_CLOSED for exchange processing
**	1-apr-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Added QEN16_ORIG_FIRST for parallel processing.
**	21-apr-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Added node_sort_flags to return partition group info.
**	27-apr-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Added QEN32_PGROUP_DONE for combo PC joins/partition quals.
**	14-Jul-2004 (schka24)
**	    Remove unused kjoin node-access flags.
**	    Add kjoin stuff for partitioned kjoin inners.
**	21-july-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Add QEN64_ORIG_NORESET to help guide reset/partition group
**	    logic in qenorig.c.
**	6-sep-04 (inkdo01)
**	    Add node_outer_count to refine group merge join logic.
**	18-Jul-2005 (schka24)
**	    Move physical partition number to generic area.
**	17-Aug-2005 (schka24)
**	    More flags, orig status stuff to support orig partition
**	    qualification on physical partitions, early hash join exit at
**	    inner/outer EOF.

** Description:

**	An open instance can be in one of three states:
**	    - Open and being used by an action
**	    - Open and not being used by an action
**	    - Closed (ie. an empty struct to be used).
**	These states are useful because tables can be opened many times
**	during the processing of a query. This allows us to reuse
**	open instances of a table, reducing the number of times that
**	we open a table, reducing our cpu cost.
**	This is also a part of the resource list processing. When a resource
**	list is validated, we open the tables as we can table ids. The
**	tables are put on the open/not used list, and are used by the
**	next action that uses the table.
**
**	Currently, we keep track of open instances of valid structs. As
**	soon as we get some DMF support we will move to keeping track of
**	dmr_cb/dmt_cb's. This change will allow us to make the maximum
**	reduction in cpu cost

/*}
** Name: QEE_XADDRS - Execution Time Addresses
**
** Description:
**
**	Finding QP things at execution time is a bit convoluted,
**	mostly because the QP itself has to be read-only, thread-
**	safe, and multiple-query-safe.  So anything in a node (say)
**	that is meant to be a pointer to some run-time data structure,
**	such as an ADE_EXCB or DMR_CB, may not be a pointer.  Instead,
**	it's usually a control block index.  At runtime, we can
**	find the proper address by doing something like:
**	    addr = dsh->dsh_cbs[control_block_number];
**
**	In some cases, particularly for node CX control blocks, doing
**	this over and over is a pain.  There are lots of different
**	control block numbers, themselves often accessed through
**	various QP sub-structures.  Once a DSH is set up for a thread
**	to run a (sub)query, the control block addresses don't change.
**	So, for some of the most common ones which are directly related
**	to QP things like node CX's, we'll resolve the addresses at
**	DSH setup time and store them in a QEE_XADDR structure for
**	the node.  Thus, the runtime address resolution becomes:
**	    addr = dsh->dsh_xaddrs[node_num]->qex_whatever;
**
**	which doesn't look simpler, but actually is, when you consider
**	the complexities of getting at some control-block-number's.
**
**	One QEE_XADDRS is allocated for each node and action in
**	the QP; in fact, we allocate "qp_stat_cnt" of 'em, just
**	like the QEN_STATUS structures.
**
**	I'm not a big fan of the prefix-style member naming club, but
**	in this case I'm doing it because the same names are used in
**	too many other contexts, and it's hard to grep.
**
**	Side note:  QEN_STATUS is inappropriate for holding resolved
**	addresses, because it's cleared at the start of every execution.
**	The QEE_XADDR is set up with the DSH and lives unchanged through
**	multiple (repeated) executions.
**
** History:
**	12-Jan-2006 (kschendel)
**	    Create to make runtime CB accessing easier.
