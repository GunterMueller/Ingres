**	execution of the COPY command.
**
** History:
**      01-dec-1986 (rogerk)
**          Written.
**	06-apr-1987 (rogerk)
**	    Added CPY_CONTINUE status which specifies that the user wants to
**	    continue with the copy when errors are encountered. 
**	06-apr-1987 (rogerk)
**	    Took out definition of CPY_VARROWS as it was a FE only concern.
**	29-apr-1991 (Derek)
**	    Added support for EMPTYTABLE clause to copy.
**	26-jul-1993 (rmuth)
**	    Added support for COPY to take a variable number of WITH

** obey double-quote escaping with quote doubling.)
