** Name: OPO_SORT - structure defining multi-attribute orderings
**
** Description:
**      This is a general
**      mechanism for defining interesting orderings based on set of
**      equivalence classes (rather than individual equivalence classes).
**      This would eventually be used to define multi-attributes joins
**      and sorts to the optimizer cost model.  
**
**      Bitmaps of OPO_ISORT types would be difficult to maintain since
**      the structure will grow during the enumeration phase, but 
**      multi-attribute sorts are designed so that bitmaps of OPO_ISORT
**      is not required.
**
**      There are exact and inexact orderings, the inexact orderings
**      are a simple set of equivalence classes.  The exact orderings
**      can include inexact orderings in the list but can never include
**      another exact ordering in its' opo_eqorder list.
**
**      This structure is used to describe multi-attribute orderings. 
**      Logically, it can be considered an extension of the equivalence
**      class array.  Any OPO_ISORT index which is in range of the equivalence
**      class array will be considered to represent an ordering on that 
**      equivalence class only (single attribute).  Any OPO_ISORT out of
**      range of the equivalence class array will represent one of these
**      multi-attribute ordering structures.  This is done so that
**      bit vectors on "interesting orderings" can be defined.
