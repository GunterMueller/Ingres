/**
**
**  Name: PSLRNGFCN.C - Functions for managing range variables
**
**  Description:
**      QUEL, unlike SQL, first looks for a table name owned by the current
**	user, then by the dba.  This file contains the functions that
**	implement the search path.
**
**          psl_rngent - Enter a range variable, looking first for a table
**			 owned by the current user, then for one owned by the
**			 dba, then for one owned by $ingres (system catalog).
**
**	    psl0_rngent - like above but doesn't report table not found errors.
**
**          psl_orngent - Enter a range variable, looking for a table owned by
**			  specified user.
**
**	    psl0_orngent - like above but doesn't report table not found errors.
**
**  	Static functions:
**	    psl_syn_id	- determine id of a synonym, given its name and owner
**
**  History:
**      18-may-86 (jeff)    
**          written
**	10-may-88 (stec)
**	    Added psl_orngent.
**	12-aug-88 (stec)
**	    Modified psl0_rngent to make sure the owner is the current user
**	    or the DBA or $ingres.
**	03-oct-88 (andre)
**	    modified psl_rngent to receive and pass query mode to psl0_rngent
**	12-jan-90 (andre)
**	    modiifed psl0_rngent() to not automatiacally check tables owned by
**	    user, then dba, then $ingres.  Instead user needs to specify whether
**	    tables owned by the user (PSS_USRTBL) and/or dba (PSS_DBATBL)
**	    and/or $ingres (PSS_INGTBL) are to be checked.
**	09-apr-90 (andre)
**	    psl_rngent(), psl_orngent(), psl0_rngent() and psl0_orngent() will
**	    notify the caller if the supplied name was that of a synonym.
**	    Additionally, psl[0]_rngent() will also indicate if the object or
**	    synonym retrieved is owned by the user, DBA, or $INGRES.
**	12-sep-90 (teresa)
**	    make the following booleans become bitflags in pss_ses_flag: 
**	    pss_fips_mode
**	14-jan-92 (barbara)
**	    Included ddb.h for Star.
**	21-apr-92 (barbara)
**	    Updated for Sybil.  Pass in mask to psl0_rngent for distributed
**	    thread.  Values will be mapped to RDF masks.
**	18-nov-92 (barbara)
**	    Changed interface to psl0_orngent to pass in Star-specific flags
**	    (same as psl0_rngent).
**	03-apr-93 (ralph)
**	    DELIM_IDENT:
**	    Use pss_cat_owner instead of "$ingres"
**      23-mar-93 (smc)
**          Fixed up prototyped function pointer declarations.
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	13-aug-93 (andre)
**	    fixed causes of ACC warnings
**	15-sep-93 (swm)
**	    Added cs.h include above other header files which need its
**	    definition of CS_SID.
**	21-oct-93 (andre)
**	    added psl_syn_id() and made changes to psl0_[o]rngent() to invoke it
**	    if a synonym reference has been encountered in the course of parsing
**	    a user-generated dbproc
**      02-mar-95 (harpa06)
**          Bug #66070 - Changed error returned to user from E_US0847_2119 to
**          E_US0845_2117 since this error message was confusing people when 
**          non-existent temporary tables were being referenced.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4

** Description:
**      This function enters a range variable into the range table, first

**
** Outputs:
**	rngvar				Filled in with pointer to range variable
**	err_blk				Filled in if an error happened
**	caller_info			Filled in with info which may be of
**					interest to the caller
**
**	Returns:
**	    E_DB_OK			Success
**	    E_DB_INFO			Success but session table found
**	    E_DB_ERROR			Non-catastrophic failure
**	    E_DB_FATAL			Catastrophic failure
**	Exceptions:
**	    none
**
** Side Effects:
**	    Can cause RDF to allocate memory

**	    add scope for SQL.
**	03-oct-88 (andre)
**	    modified to receive and pass query mode to psl0_rngent 
**	12-jan-90 (andre)
**	    modiifed psl0_rngent() to not automatiacally check tables owned by
**	    user, then dba, then $ingres.  Instead user needs to specify whether
**	    tables owned by the user (PSS_USRTBL) and/or dba (PSS_DBATBL)
**	    and/or $ingres (PSS_INGTBL) are to be checked.
**	09-apr-90 (andre)
**	    Added a new field, caller_info, to pass info back to the caller
**	12-sep-90 (teresa)
**	    pss_fips_mode becomes bitflag in pss_ses_flag instead of being
**	    a boolean.
**	21-apr-92 (barbara)
**	    For Sybil, new interface to psl0_rngent requires a mask.
**	    Pass in default of 0.
**	12-aug-93 (andre)
**	    replace TABLES_TO_CHECK() with PSS_USRTBL|PSS_DBATBL|PSS_INGTBL.
**	    TABLES_TO_CHECK() was being used because long time ago we made an
**	    assumption that 3-tier name space will not be used when processing 
**	    SQL queries while running in FIPS mode.  That assumption proved to 
**	    be incorrect and there is no longer a need to use this macro
**	23-may-06 (toumi01)
**	    Allow session temporary tables to be referenced without the
**	    "session." in DML. This eliminates the need for this Ingres-
**	    specific extension, which is a hinderance to app portability.
**	24-aug-06 (toumi01)
**	    Rewrite "session." optional change to clean up from Karl's
**	    changes, to allow perm and temp tables to have the same name, to
**	    make the feature conditional on a config.dat parameter to handle
**	    backward compatibility issues, and to minimize extra lookups.
**	31-aug-06 (toumi01)
**	    GTT syntax shortcut is now implicitly turned on when a dgtt
*	    command is parsed without "session." specified for the name.
**	    Thus, "old style" and "new style" applications can coexist
**	    in one installation with no need for a config.dat option.

**	    add scope for SQL
**	12-jan-90 (andre)
**	    let user specify whether tables owned by the user and/or dba and/or
**	    $ingres are to be looked for.
**	11-apr-90 (andre)
**	    Added a new field, caller_info, to pass info back to the caller
**	    it will be used to indicate if the name
**	    supplied by the user was that of a synonym + indicate if the
**	    object or synonym whose name was specified by the caller was owned
**	    by the user, DBA, or $INGRES
**	26-jun-90 (andre)
**	    if a synonym is encountered in a QUEL query, we will act as if it
**	    was never seen unless we are checking for duplicate object names in
**	    CREATE/DEFINE VIEW/RETRIEVE INTO.
**	21-apr-92 (barbara)
**	    For Sybil, pass in mask of values to be mapped into RDF values.
**	    Also, pass in session control block to pst_sent and pst_rgent
**	    and eliminate session and user id parameters.
**	11-may-92 (andre)
**	    if a table could not be looked up in the course of parsing a dbproc
**	    definition, set PSS_MISSING_OBJ in cb->pss_dbp_flags
**	18-nov-92 (barbara)
**	    Reset err_code before looking up table; otherwise old error code
**	    stays around and may be used erroneously by caller.
**	21-oct-93 (andre)
**	    If the name specified by the caller was that of a synonym and we 
**	    are parsing a definition of a non-system generated dbproc, we will 
**	    invoke psl_syn_id() to determine id of the synonym - this id will 
**	    be stored in the dbproc's independent object list so that whenever 
**	    the synonym is dropped, the dbproc will be marked dormant
**	11-feb-94 (andre)
**	    fix for bug 59707:
**	    when checking whether the object was referenced through a synonym, 
**	    we must avoid mistaking a reference to the input set of a set-input
**	    dbproc for a reference to a synonym; we can detect an input set 
**	    reference by checking whether pss_rgtype is PST_SETINPUT
**	08-apr-94 (andre)
**	    the code in this function was making an (incorrect) assumption that
**	    caller would not ask us to look for $ingres' table without asking us
**	    to look for a table owned by the current use or by the DBA.  
**	    This assumption is violated when in the course of processing 
**	    CREATE TABLE we attempt to verify that a table with a given name 
**	    is not already owned by the current user or by $ingres 
**	    (WITHOUT CHECKING WHETHER IT IS OWNED BY THE DBA.)  As a result, 
**	    an attempt by to create a table iirelation by $ingres on a 
**	    database of which $ingres is a DBA (e.g. iidbdb) does get caught 
**	    in PSF and is instead caught in DMF.  
**	   
**	    To correct the problem, we will skip checking for existence of a 
**	    table owned by DBA if the current user is the DBA AND we have 
**	    already checked for existence of the table owned by the current 
**	    user.  Similarly, we will skip checking for existence of the table 
**	    owned by $ingres if the current user is $ingres AND we checked for 
**	    existence of the table owned by the current user or the DBA is $
**	    ingres AND we checked for existence of the table owned by the DBA
**	30-apr-02 (inkdo01)
**	    Added support for PSS_SESTBL flag to request access to SQL-generated
**	    global temporary tables.
**	24-aug-06 (toumi01)
**	    For "session." optional change to handle getting all four search
**	    flags set in one go, and return E_DB_INFO if we end up finding
**	    a session temporary table.
**	31-aug-06 (toumi01)
**	    For SIR 116264 fix E_DB_WARN s.b. E_DB_INFO typo.
**	26-sep-06 (toumi01)
**	    For GTT lookup changes fix init of err_code for USRTBL search.
**	29-dec-2006 (dougi)
**	    Call to new function pst_swelem() to potentially resolve table 
**	    references against with list elements.
