/**
** Name: CSINTERNAL.H - Internal Control System Module definitions
**
** Description:
**      This file contains the definitions of datatypes and constants
**      used within the CS module.
**
** History: $Log-for RCS$
**      29-Oct-1986 (fred)
**          Created.
**	26-sep-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added thread priority constants.
**	31-oct-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added CS_ACCNTING_MASK to server block cs_mask.  This specifies
**	    whether or not to write records to the accounting file for each
**	    dbms session.
**	    Added CS_CPUSTAT_MASK to server block cs_mask.  This specifies
**	    that the server should keep track of cpu times on a thread by
**	    thread basis.
**	 7-nov-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added fields in the CS_SYSTEM control block in which asynchronous
**	    routines can write values without colliding with other threads.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added cs_pid field and stats for cross process semaphores to server
**	    control block.
**	09-oct-1990 (ralph)
**	    6.3->6.5 merge:
**	    21-mar-1990 (fred)
**		Added CPU Governor support.
**	    23-apr-90 (bryanp)
**		Added new statistics to the cs_wtstatistics field in the
**		Cs_srv_block to record information about CS_GWFIO_MASK - type
**		suspensions. These are used by non-SQL gateways.
**	15-jan-91 (ralph)
**          Change extent of CS_STARTUP_MSG.cs_options to CS_OPTMAX
**	4-jul-92 (daveb)
**		Add SPTREEs to CS_SYSTEM for scb, sem, and conditions.
**	1-Sep-1993 (seiwald)
**	    CS_OPTIONS and CS_STARTUP_MSG gone, as startup parameters no
**	    longer traverse the CL interface.  Added a few flags to the
**	    bottom of CS_SYSTEM to hold parameters once held in the
**	    startup message.  Commented as "defunct" cs_multiple in
**	    CS_SYSTEM, but didn't delete it: every csll.*.s depends on
**	    hardwired offsets into CS_SYSTEM!
**	31-jan-1994 (bryanp) B56917
**	    Added FUNC_EXTERN for CSoptions.
**	20-jun-1995 (dougb)
**	    Cross integrate my change 274733 from ingres63p:
**	  31-may-95 (dougb)
**	    Add "volatile" to CS_SYSTEM and CS_ADMIN_SCB definitions and
**	    force compiler to longword align all examples in an attempt to
**	    avoid CL_INVALID_READY problems.  We want to avoid any code
**	    holding part of these structures in registers when the
**	    asynchronous routine CSresume() happens to run.  Don't want to
**	    resort to compiling the entire system "/noopt" again.
**	25-sep-95 (dougb)
**	    Remove now-useless member_alignment pragmas.
**	21-dec-95 (dougb)
**	    Undo previous change.
**	22-feb-96 (albany)
**	    Cross-integrated jenjo02's Unix change of 16-jan-1996:
**		Changed cs_sm_* to cs_tm_*. cs_sm_* wasn't being used, so
**		cs_tm_* fields will be used to account for time-only  
**		CSsuspend() wait reasons.
**		Added cs_lge_*, cs_lke_* fields in which to track CSsuspend()
**		calls on LK/LG events.
**	19-aug-96 (kinpa04) incorporated changes of
**		27-jul-95 by jenjo02 of cs_hwm_active
**		25-oct-95 by thaju02/stoli02 wait on CSEVENT counter
**	30-Jul-97 (teresak) incorportated changes from Unix CL to VMS CL for 
**		threads
**		04-oct-1995 (wonst02)
**                Add cs_facility to CS_SYSTEM for the address of scs_facility().
**		03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**                Modified for operating system threads.
**                Add cs_facility to CS_SYSTEM for Unix as well as NT.

**                statistics for thread semaphores.
**              18-nov-1996 (canor01)
**                Synchronization primitives in CS_SYSTEM for the splay trees 
**		  are for OS-thread systems only.
**              10-dec-96 (hanch04)
**                moved cs_facility, offset is hardcoded in cs.
**      	5-dec-96 (stephenb)
**      	  Add definition of CS_PROFILE to CS_SYSTEM for profiling.
**      	18-feb-1997 (hanch04)
**        	  As part of merging of Ingres-threaded and OS-threaded servers,
**        	  CS_SYSTEM will contain both versions for SMSTAT
**      	28-feb-1997 (hanch04)
**        	  cs_mt will be part of CS_SYSTEM for threads or no threads
**      	21-may-1997 (shero03)
**           	  Add definition of CS_DEV_TRCENTRY for debugging
**      	03-Jul-97 (radve01)

**		  order to facilitate debugging.
**      	26-Aug-1997 (kosma01)
**          	  For OS_THREADS_USED, cast special session ids into threads
**          	  friendly types. Also add a NULL session id CS_NULL_ID.

/*}
** Name: CS_SYSTEM - Overall control structure for the Control System
**
** Description:
**      This structure describes the overall control structure which is used 
**      throughout the CS module, and, therefore, is the central structure 
**      of the entire system in which the CS module is running.  This structure 
**      supplies the anchor points for the ready and wait queues in use in the 
**      system, the anchor for the list of known sessions, the anchor for the
**      connection request block list, and the location for numerous bits of 
**      interesting information about how things are running, etc.
**
**	This structure is referenced and possibly altered by any thread in
**	the system.  Any thread that alters information in the CS_SYSTEM
**	control block must take care that it is protected from changing
**	it at that same time as another thread.  Also, some CS routines
**	are triggered by asynchronous events and these also may alter fields
**	in the CS_SYSTEM control block.  There are three methods used by
**	the CS system to protect itself while changing CS_SYSTEM information.
**
**	    1) Turn off ASTs.  Since CS uses AST's to drive asynchronous
**	       events, no unexpected events can occur while we have AST's
**	       disabled.  This includes quantum based thread switching.  While
**	       ASTs are disabled, the current thread will not be switched out
**	       by the quantum timer - it can only be switched out if it
**	       asks to be.  A session may safely alter CS_SYSTEM control block
**	       fields while ASTs are disabled, but should always take care
**	       enable ASTs when done.
**
**	    2) Turn on cs_inkernel flag. This flag in the CS_SYSTEM control
**	       block specifies that the current session should not be switched
**	       out involuntarily.  Similar to turning off ASTs, when this
**	       flag is on the quantum timer will not switch the current thread
**	       out - the thread can only be switched out on request.  Note,
**	       however, that turning on the cs_inkernel flag does not prevent
**	       asynchronous CS routines from being called.
**
**	       A CS routine that is called directly by a thread (not by way
**	       of an AST) may alter most CS_SYSTEM control block information
**	       safely while the cs_inkernel flag is turned on.  The only
**	       fields that cannot be safely altered are the async field
**	       described below in method (3).  The CS routine should be
**	       careful to turn off the cs_inkernel flag when done, and to
**	       follow the protocol described in below in (3) regarding the
**	       async fields.
**
**	       Some CS routines run in the context of an AST.  These routines
**	       are CSresume, CSattn, and CSquantum.  These routines are
**	       protected from AST's, but since thay may be signalled while
**	       another thread was in the middle of altering CS_SYSTEM
**	       information, they may not change any fields that they want to.
**	       If an AST driven routine sees that the cs_inkernel field is not
**	       on, then it may safely alter any field in the CS control block.
**	       If an AST routine sees that the cs_inkernel field is ON, then
**	       it may alter NO FIELDS except for the async ones described below.
**
**	    3) Use of cs_async fields.  In the CS_SYSTEM control block are
**	       fields which can be used only by atomic routines which are
**	       protected from ASTs.  These fields are:  cs_async, cs_as_list,
**	       cs_scb_async_cnt, and cs_asadd_thread.  When an AST driven CS
**	       routine is called while the cs_inkernel flag is set, that routine
**	       may write only into these special CS_SYSTEM fields.  It must then
**	       make sure that the 'cs_async' field is ON.
**
**	       When a non-AST driven CS routine turns off the cs_inkernel flag,
**	       it must check the cs_async field of the CS_SYSTEM control block.
**	       If that field is set, then the CS routine must turn off AST's
**	       and move all information from the async fields into the regular
**	       portions of the CS_SYSTEM control block.
**
**	NOTE : This structure reference inside CSLL.MAR with hard-wired
**	offsets to some of the fields.  Any changes to the layout of
**	this structure will require changes in the offset definitions in
**	CSLL.MAR as well.

**
** History:
**      27-Oct-1986 (fred)
**          Initial Definition.
**	 7-nov-1988 (rogerk)
**	    Added fields - cs_async, cs_as_list, cs_scb_async_cnt and
**	    cs_asadd_thread - for asynchronous routines to write information
**	    into.  This is to enable CS to do most operations without having
**	    to enable/disable asts.
**	28-feb-1989 (rogerk)
**	    Added cs_pid field and stats for cross process semaphores.
**	09-oct-1990 (ralph)
**	    6.3->6.5 merge:
**	    23-apr-90 (bryanp)
**		Added statistics for CS_GWFIO_MASK waits to the wait statistics.
**	20-jun-1995 (dougb)
**	    Cross integrate my change 274733 from ingres63p:
**	  31-may-95 (dougb)
**	    Force compiler to longword align all examples of this structure
**	    type in an attempt to avoid CL_INVALID_READY problems.  Reduces
**	    the possibility that updates to one field in asynchronous code
**	    (running at AST level in VMS terms) will be lost/invalidated by
**	    a change to an adjacent field in synchronous code.  Also,
**	    shortens the number of instructions during which a field will be
**	    kept in registers.  This is similar to a change markg made to
**	    the CS_SCB structure (on or before 22-feb-95) in ingres63p.
**	25-sep-95 (dougb)
**	    Remove now-useless member_alignment pragmas.
**	21-dec-95 (dougb)
**	    Undo previous change.
**	22-feb-96 (albany)
**	    Cross-integrated jenjo02's change of 16-jan-1996:
**		Changed cs_sm_* to cs_tm_*. cs_sm_* wasn't being used, so
**		cs_tm_* fields will be used to account for time-only  
**		CSsuspend() wait reasons.
**		Added cs_lge_*, cs_lke_* fields in which to track CSsuspend()
**		calls on LK/LG events.
**      30-Jul-97 (teresak) incorporated changes from Unix CL to VMS CL for
**              threads
**      	13-Aug-1996 (jenjo02)
**                 Modified cs_smstatistics in CS_SYSTEM to provide better-fit
**                 statistics for thread semaphores.
**      	18-nov-1996 (canor01)
**      	   Synchronization primitives for the splay trees are for
**      29-Jan-99 (hanal04, horda03)
**          Added statistics required as part of re-engineering of
**          CSp_semaphore() and CSv_semaphore().
**          	   OS-thread systems only.
**      29-Jan-99 (hanal04, horda03)
