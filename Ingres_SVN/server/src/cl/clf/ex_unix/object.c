**  Name: object - Object file analysis
**
**  Description:
**      This module contains the object file specific logic for locating symbol
**      table entries and loadable areas
**
**      The following routine is supplied:-
**
**      DIAGObjectRead    - Read details of an object file
**
**  History:
**	14-Mch-1996 (prida01)
**	    Make object file accept location as parameter instead of
**	    file name for portability.
**	04-dec-1996 (canor01)
**	    Remove unneeded include of map.h.
**	06-Nov-1998 (muhpa01)
**	    Created DIAGObjectRead() in support of stack tracing on HP-UX.
**	21-jan-1999 (hanch04)
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	31-aug-2000 (hanch04)
**	    cross change to main
**	    replace nat and longnat with i4
**	17-Sep-2007 (bonro01)
**	    Add CS_sol_dump_stack for su4_us5, su9_us5, a64_sol for
**	    both 32bit and 64bit stack tracing.
**	    Remove Solaris routines because symbols are now looked up
**	    differently.

**  Name: DIAGObjectRead - Read details from an object file
**
**  Description:
**      This routine locates the symbol table and list of loadable areas from
**      an object file and remembers them for future use. (most of the work
**      is done by the symbol and map routines this routine simply provides
**      the required driving code). Uses the a.out format.
**
**      The list of loadable areas is in the program header, a pointer to this
**      is obtained via the ELF library.
**
**  Inputs:
**      LOC *loc    	- Object file location
**      i4  offset      - Address it is loaded to (for shared libraries)
**
**  Side effects:
**      Keeps a file descriptor to the object file to allow areas of store
**      to be read in as required
**
**  Exceptions:
**      Calls DIAGerror() function with errors
**
**  History:
**	01-Apr-1996 (prida01)
**	    Fix to remove macro for addresses
