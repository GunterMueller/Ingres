**
**	Revision 6.3  89/11  wong
**	Added illegal file-name message, E_AB0138.
**
**	90/03  wong  Added unsupported language message, E_AB0139.
**	23-oct-1990 (mgw)
**		Corrected some misspellings. All are in comments, not messages,
**		but these comments get picked up for the messages.txt file via
**		erxtract and are thus in a deliverable.
**	14-aug-91 (blaise)
**		Added E_AB0154_NoObjFile.
**	22-aug-91 (blaise)
**		E_AB0154_NoObjFile now only takes one argument.
**	26-feb-1992 (mgw)
**		Added E_AB0155_OSCompErr.
**	28-feb-1992 (mgw) Bug #41111
**		Made S_AB0146_ReturnChange and S_AB0148_FrameChange obsolete
**		and replaced them with S_AB0156_NewReturnChange and
**		S_AB0157_NewFrameChange respectively to have these messages
**		refer to frames or procedures as appropriate instead of just
**		frames.
**	16-Nov-1992 (donc) Bug #44162
**		Added E_AB036_BadSymbolName 
**	13-oct-92 (davel)
**		Added fast messages for support of the new Global Constants 
**		File utility screen - F_AB00E0 through F_AB00E6.
**	26-oct-92 (davel)
**		Added E_AB0129 and E_AB012A for global constant backward
**		compatibilty warnings.
**	20-nov-92 (mgw)
**		Added more fast messages for Global Constants support.
**		F_AB00E7 - F_AB00EA will be used in an IIUFccConfirmChoice
**		call.
**	12-jan-93 (essi)
**		Added several messages for the support of global constants
**		file.
**	15-jan-93 (davel)
**		Added E_AB012B_TypeChange (datatype of global constant cannot
**		be changed during "edit a constant" operation). Also made
**		small changes to other global constant messages.
**	11-feb-93 (blaise)
**		Integrated DonC's change from 63p code line: added
**		E_AB036B_Bad_SymbolName
**	18-Feb-1993 (connie) Bug #48982
**		Added S_AB0158_RunHostLangProc,F_AB00BC_Title,F_AB00BD_Yestext,
**		F_AB00BE_Notext, F_AB00BF_CHelp
**	23-feb-1993 (connie) Bug #40884
**		Added E_AB0281_PathName to check for pathname in source file
**	22-feb-93 (davel)
**		Added E_AB036A_Bad_PassDecimal message.
**	26-jul-93 (blaise)
**		Added F_AB00EB to F_AB00EF - comments written to global
**		constants file.
**	16-mar-94 (lan)
**		Fixed bug #58066 - Replaced 'Technical Support Representative'
**		with 'Site Technical Contact'.

**	Defines messages for the copy application utility, COPYAPP.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.0  10-aug-1987 (Joe)
**	Initial Version.
**	02-nov-89 (marian)
**		Replace "Technical Support Representative" with "Site
**		Technical Contact".
**	23-oct-1990 (mgw)
**		Corrected some misspellings. All are in comments, not messages,
**		but these comments get picked up for the messages.txt file via
**		erxtract and are thus in a deliverable.
**	14-nov-1990 (blaise)
**		Change text of E_CA000C_BADFLAG, removing usage message; add
**		a new message S_CA0026_Correct_syntax to be displayed after
**		E_CA000C_BADFLAG or E_CA000A_DIRECTION. (bug 34312).
**	26-jul-93 (blaise)
**		Added F_CA0005_Application, to replace literal string in
**		caout.sc.

/**
** Name:	ercg.msg -	Code Generator Error Message Definitions File.
**
** Description:
**	Contains the error message definitions for the code generator.
**	Since the code generator uses as input the intermediate language
**	created by the OSL translator, it should never encounter an
**	error in its input.  An error message from the code generator
**	indicates a bug that should be reported to RTI.
**
** History:
**	Revision 6.0  87/08/07  arthur
**	Initial revision.
**	16-mar-94 (lan)
**		Fixed bug #58066 - Replaced 'Technical Support Representative'

space to create files within this directory."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The code generator could not open the file specified on the command-line
**	(passed by ABF) into which it will generate C code for a frame/procedure
**	object.  This could be for several reasons, but most likely is because
**	you do not have access rights either to the directory in which the file
**	is to be created (usually the ABF object code directory) or to the
**	output file if it already exists, or because you have exceeded the disk
**	space available to you in that directory.

E_DC000B_BYTETYPE	
"Warning: Table '%0c' contains column(s) of 'byte', 'byte varying', or
'long byte' datatype(s).  These have been mapped to character string 
variables.  If your application does inserts or updates of byte datatypes 
across a heterogeneous INGRES/NET connection, you must use Dynamic SQL and 
specify an appropriate byte datatype in the sqlvar entries of your SQLDA to
ensure that the data does not go through character-set translation when
transmitted from client machine to server machine."
/*
** Explanation:
**	In non-C languages there are no embedded types that uniquely correspond
**	to 'byte', 'byte varying', or 'long byte' datatypes.  Those types are 
**	mapped to character string variables.  This works fine for retrieval
**	of byte data, and even works for inserts or updates when the client and
**	server machines use identical character sets.
**
**	However, when your application does inserts or updates of byte data
**	across heterogeneous INGRES/NET, you must use Dynamic SQL and specify
**	an appropriate byte datatype in the sqlvar entries of your SQLDA.
**	That is the only way to inform ESQL that you are sending "byte" data
**	and not character data.  By default, data from character string 
**	variables will be sent as character data, and may go through
**	character-set translation when transmitted from client machine to 
**	server machine.  To prevent that translation, you must explicitly
**	identify it as a "byte" datatype in the SQLDA.
**
**	This warning message will be displayed to the Standard Output stream, 
**	but will not be included in the generated file.
**
** System Status:
**	Program will continue.
**
** User Action:
**	For insert or update operations on "byte" data, the user may need 
**	to use Dynamic SQL, specifying the appropriate "byte" datatype in
**	the sqlvar entries of the SQLDA.

**	The table includes a column with a decimal data type that exceeds 18,

**
** User Action:
*/

E_E1000D_hfNOSQLCODE	"SQLCODE has been declared, but the -sqlcode flag

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Because the standard SQLCA include file declares an SQLCODE,
**	which would duplicate the one you've just declared, you must 
**	use the -sqlcode flag.  This flag tells the preprocessor that 
**	the application has already declared an SQLCODE before it tries

E_E60001_haMUSTINDIR	"The ADA variable '%0c' is an array and must be subscripted."

/*
** Explanation:
**	A variable declared as an array must be subscripted when referenced.
**	The preprocessor does not confirm that you use the correct number
**	of subscripts.  A variable declared as a 1-dimensional array of
**	characters, must not be subscripted as it refers to a character
**	string.
**
** System Status:
**
** User Action:
*/

E_E60002_haCANTINDIR	"The ADA variable '%0c' is not an array and must not be subscripted."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A variable not declared as an array cannot be subscripted.  You cannot
**	subscript string variables in order to refer to a single character or
**	a slice of a string (sub-string).

E_E60004_haCHARDIMS	"The ADA CHARACTER variable '%0c' must be a 1-dimensional array."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Variables of type CHARACTER can only be declared as 1-dimensional
**	arrays.  You cannot use a single character or a multi-dimensional
**	array of characters as an INGRES string.  Note that you can use a 
**	multidimensional array of type STRING.

E_E60006_haINCPKG	"Statement '%0c' is embedded in INCLUDE file package specification."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Preprocessor INCLUDE files may only be used for ADA package
**	specifications.  The preprocessor generates an ADA WITH clause
**	for the package. No executable statements may be included in the
**	file because the code generated will not be accepted by the ADA
**	compiler in a package specification.

**	30-jan-88 (marian)
**		Added E_EQ0504_COMMON_WARN and added F_EQ0505_eqFL11
**		to add common sql warning messages.
**	10-feb-89 (marian)
**		Changed the wording for E_EQ0504_COMMON_WARN so it now says

**		Added E_EQ0512_OPEN_CLAUSE.
**	23-oct-1990 (mgw)
**		Corrected some misspellings. All are in comments, not messages,
**		but these comments get picked up for the messages.txt file via
**		erxtract and are thus in a deliverable.
**	14-feb-1991 (teresal)
**		Added E_EQ0513_OPEN_OP.
**	05-mar-1991 (barbara)
**		Added E_EQ0378_repWHERE to flag use of a dynamic WHERE clause

**	    E_EQ051E_FIPS_CINITVAL, which is now obsolete.  It was an
**	    SQL89 issue, no longer valid in SQL92 entry level.)
**	14-apr-1994 (teresal)

E_EQ0001_eqNOMEM	"Fatal memory allocation error in routine '%1c'.\n
The product has run out of memory after requesting %0c bytes for internal data."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A memory allocation or free error has occurred somewhere in
**	the code in a place where it was unexpected, or where it
**	was not possible to recover from the error.  This may indicate an
**	internal coding error or a program that is too large. 
**
** System Status:
**	The preprocessor will abort.
**
** User Action:
**	Check your system quotas.  If you suspect they might be too low, 
**	try to break up the input file or the embedded language blocks.
**	If the preprocessor still fails, call your INGRES support person.
*/



E_EQ0002_eqNOTABLE	"Fatal attempt to access internal table.\n
No host code generator table is defined in the preprocessor."

** Explanation:
**	A required internal data structure could not be accessed.  This
**	may be caused by an incorrectly linked preprocessor image or an
**	internal coding error.
**
** System Status:
**	The preprocessor will abort.
**
** User Action:
**	Contact your INGRES support person.
*/

E_EQ0003_eqNULL "Null type pointer in routine '%0c'.\n
An internal symbol has not been initialized or has been reset." 

/*%
** Explanation:

**	an internal coding error.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	If the preprocessor reported syntax errors, correct them and
**	repreprocess your file.  If the error occurs again, contact your
**	INGRES support person.
*/

E_EQ0004_eqTRACEFL	"Conflicting %0c '-to' and '-tl' options."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	This error is caused by an inconsistent use of the internal trace
**	-t flag when invoking the preprocessor.  Under normal circumstances
**	it should not be necessary to use trace flags.
**
** System Status:
**	The preprocessor will exit without preprocessing the input file.
**
** User Action:
**	Retype the preprocessor command line using the correct flags.
*/

E_EQ0005_eqINFILE	"%0c input file '%1c' cannot be opened.\n
Error in location or name of file or you have no read permission."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The preprocessor cannot find the input file named on the command
**	line.  The location/directory path specified may be incorrect,
**	the file name itself may be incorrectly entered, or the file may
**	be non-existent.  An extremely long path name will also cause this
**	error.
**	
** System Status:
**	The preprocessor will exit without preprocessing the input file.
**
** User Action:
**	Retype the preprocessor command line correctly specifying the 
**	input file.
*/

E_EQ0006_eqOUTOPT	"Conflicting %0c '-f' options.\n
You cannot direct both to the standard output channel and to a file."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	This error occurs when the -f flag is used twice on the command line,
**	once without an argument and once with a file name.  For example:
**		preproc -f -foutfilename
**	Note that if the the -f flag is not used, the preprocessor will
**	create an output file with the default name.
**	
** System Status:
**	The preprocessor will exit without preprocessing the input file.
**
** User Action:
**	Select the appropriate output option and retype the preprocessor
**	command line.
*/

E_EQ0007_eqOUTFILE	"Cannot open %0c output file '%1c'.\n
Check write permission and -f flag argument, if used."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Output files cannot be opened if a user does not have write
**	privileges.  If the -f flag was specified, the location or directory
**	path given must be a legal location.  There may be other system 
**	dependent reasons why a file cannot be opened.
**
** System Status:
**	The preprocessor will exit without preprocessing the input file.
**	
** User Action:
**	Attempt to open a file with the same name at the system level and take
**	note of the system response.

**	This also applies to the PUTOPER function.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Correct the syntax of the current statement.
*/

E_EQ0053_grFMINTFUNC	"Forms '%0c' function is integer valued.\n
You must use an integer variable for the result of this function."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The variable used to receive the result of the above FRS function 
**	has a type other than integer.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Correct the current syntax to use an integer variable which
**	has been declared to the preprocessor.
*/

E_EQ0054_grNOPARENS	"Empty parentheses are ignored.\n
No parentheses are required on empty target lists."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	Some statements have optional target lists.  In some cases, when
**	empty target lists are used, this warning is displayed. 
**
** System Status:
**	The preprocessor will ignore the parentheses and will return
**	a SUCCESS status if no other errors occur during preprocessing.
**
** User Action:
**	Remove the unnecessary parentheses.
*/

E_EQ0055_grFMPARAM	"Illegal context for PARAM clause in forms statement.\n
You may not use the PARAM clause in this statement."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	In the languages that support PARAM target lists, not all forms 
**	target lists have a PARAM equivalent.  The statements that have
**	a PARAM equivalent are documented in the preprocessor manual.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Rewrite the forms target list using host variables declared to the
**	preprocessor instead of the PARAM clause.
*/

E_EQ0056_grFORMNAME	"Form name required for %0c statement.\n
The %0c statement used outside of a DISPLAY loop requires a form name."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	A forms I/O statement that is syntactically outside of a DISPLAY
**	loop requires a form name specification.   Inside the DISPLAY
**	loop the currently displayed form is assumed if no form is
**	specified.  This error may also occur if the DISPLAY statement
**	contained a syntax error.
**	
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.
**
** User Action:
**	Check the syntax on the DISPLAY statement.  Otherwise, include a 
**	form name in the statement, or move the statement inside a DISPLAY loop.
*/

E_EQ0057_grHOSTVAR	"'%0c' expected to be a simple variable.\n
Use a scalar numeric or character string variable instead of '%0c'."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	The named identifier was used in an I/O statement, but was not
**	declared to the preprocessor as a scalar numeric or character
**	string variable.
**
** System Status:
**	Upon completion, the preprocessor will return a FAIL status.

Found bad Visual Query variable in ##IF stmt\n
An error occurred trying to generate 4gl code for this frame.
The ##IF statement on line %0d of template file '%1c' contains a
reference to '%2c',
which is either an unknown Visual Query variable, or is a Visual Query
variable that does not evaluate to TRUE or FALSE (only boolean Visual
Query variables may be used in ##IF statements). This is an error in your
template file; correct the template file '%1c' before trying to generate
4gl again."

E_FG0002_IfStmt_Nesting  "Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
An error occurred trying to generate 4gl code for this frame.

E_FG0004_Too_Many_Elses	"Error occurred while generating 4gl code\n
Template file error: too many ##ELSE stmts found.
Line %0d of template file '%1c' contains a duplicate ##ELSE statement. A
##ELSE statement has already been seen for the previous ##IF/##IFDEF statement,
so this duplicate ##ELSE is an error in the template file '%1c'. Correct the
template file before trying to generate 4gl again."

An error occurred generating 4gl code for this frame. The statement
'##INCLUDE %0c' was encountered, and cannot be processed, because that
would exceed the limit of %1d levels deep in ##INCLUDE file processing. Often
an infinite loop in your ##INCLUDE file processing will cause this error (for
example if file1 does '##INCLUDE file2', and file2 does '##INCLUDE file1',
then an infinite loop will occur). Check your template files for an

**		Parameterize msgs 8600-8601, 8650-8655, and 8814 to state
**		a field's title and internal name, internal name, or
**		'current field', depending on what's available.  OK to do
**		this because 6.4 uses a new message file format.  NOTE:
**		the '%0c' in these msgs refers to strings in the erfd.msg
**		file.  Common usage is "... the %0c", where %0c is replaced
**		by "current field", "field (title: Address, internal name:
**		home_address)", or "field (internal name: _xtitle)".
**	17-jul-90 (bruceb)
**		Changed a number of the messages so that the short version
**		would completely fit on the screen.
**	07/28/90 (dkh) - Added messages for table field cell highlighting.
**	11/26/90 (dkh) - Added messages to handle divide by zero and
**			 overflow exceptions for money and decimal types.
**	09/01/92 (dkh) - Added support for inquiring on existence of
**			 frs objects.
**	09/02/92 (dkh) - Added error messages for dynamic menus.
**	10/02/92 (dkh) - Added new messages to handle unsupported datatypes.
**	07/18/93 (dkh) - Added new messages to support purgetable.
**	07/21/93 (dkh) - Added error message E_FI226F_8815_BAD_PUTROW_STATE
**			 to support the ability to set the _STATE value
**			 at runtime with the putrow statement.
**	07/24/93 (dkh) - Added new messages that used to be hardcoded
**			 in the code.
**	17-dec-1996 (angusm)
**		add E_FI2270_8816_BadDecimal for bug 79824

/**
** Name:        erie.msg -      iiimport/iiexport message definitions
**
** Description:
**      Defines messages for the iiimport and iiexport, that wacky set
**      of tools which allows users to copy application components around.
**
**      The comment block FOLLOWING each error message gets into the
**      Error Manual, as per the coding standards. To be marginally
**      consistent, comments regarding Message strings also follow the message.
**
** History:
**      25-aug-1993 (daver)
**              First Written.
**      05-oct-1993 (daver)
**              Added E_IE003C_No_param_value message; made a nicer
**              error message for E_IE0013_No_Such_App; changed usage
**              syntax to show -copysrc | -check; added error message
**      26-jan-1994 (daver)
**              Add slow message S_IE0040_No_Allflag_Object and error messages
**              E_IE0041_No_Specified_Object and E_IE0042_Nothing_Found
**              to fix bug 57685 (no error checking for non-existant
**              object in iiexport).
**      21-apr-1994 (connie) Bug #60399
**              Correct spelling for "specified" in S_IE0040_No_Allflag_Object
**      27-oct-1994 (slawrence) Bug #60689
**              Added message E_IE0044_Dupl_File_Name for intfile and listing 
**              command line flags.

**	%1c	Size of message buffer in bytes.
**
** Explanation:
**	During a pre-fetch operation (for example, when fetching multiple rows
**	of data from a read-only cursor), the run-time system attempts to
**	allocate unread message buffers to improve the performance of
**	subsequent retrievals against the same data.  When trying to allocate

**
** User Action:
**	Confirm that you are not encountering unrelated memory errors that
**	could be due to your program corrupting the internal memory management
**	lists.  If this only occurs when trying to pre-fetch data then maybe
**	the system has exhausted all memory.  For example, a large number of

**	%0c	Internal name of message buffer (for example GCA_TUPLES).
**	%1c	Number of rows originally requested for pre-fetch operation.

**
** Explanation:
**	During a pre-fetch operation (for example, when fetching multiple rows
**	of data from a read-only cursor), the run-time system collects unread
**	rows from the DBMS and saves them away for subsequent retrievals.
**	The requested number of rows (determined by the PREFETCHROWS setting or

**	
**	A message type of GCA_TUPLES indicates that the actual data exceeded
**	the row count.  A message type of GCA_RESPONSE indicates that the
**	internal DBMS response count exceeded the value, though the data may
**	have been correct (this latter problem is less severe).
**
** System Status:
**	The run-time system aborts the current operation.  If this is a cursor

"Protocol data pre-fetch failure.\n
During a pre-fetch operation the system expected messages of types(s) %0c,

/*%
** Parameters:
**	%0c	Internal name of message buffers that are expected.
**	%1c	Internal name of message buffer encountered.
**
** Explanation:
**	During a pre-fetch operation (for example, when fetching multiple rows
**	of data from a read-only cursor), the run-time system collects unread
**	messages from the DBMS and saves them away for subsequent retrievals.
**	During this operation the system encountered an unexpected message,
**	in violation of the client-server GCA protocol.  The message could not
**	be interpreted in the current context.
**
** System Status:
**	The run-time system aborts the current operation.  If this is a cursor
**	FETCH operation then the "current" row will have been retrieved, but
**	a number of "following" pre-fetched rows will have been discarded.

**		Rewrote 'Query buffer full' F_MO000B message to be more
**		informative.  Bug #8049.
**	14-mar-1990 (teresal)
**		Added warning message for input query missing an ending quote.
**	29-aug-1990 (kathryn)
**		Changed E_MO003D Not to print CMS file_spec syntax. 
**		Changed writeout.c to check for this error and print this 
**		message on all platforms.
**	31-aug-1990 (kathryn)
**		Fixed above change to Add new error message rather change old
**		one.
**	09-nov-1990 (kathryn)
**		Added E_MO006F_P_FlagSyntax and E_MO0070_R_FlagSyntax
**	08-feb-1993 (rogerl)
**		Added E_MO0071_R_NoCmdLnPass
**	10-feb-1993 (rogerl)
**		Back out '08-feb-1993 (rogerl)'.  Not needed & message never
**		shipped.
**	13-jan-1993 (mgw)
**		Change INGRES to OpenINGRES in F_MO0033_TM_login_banner and
**		F_MO0034_INGRES_exit_message.

**              Bug 67115, modify the login message from terminal monitor.
**	31-may-1995 (harpa06)
**		Bug #68876 - Added an error message that will appear if the 
**		user is trying to invoke QUEL with a STAR database since STAR
**		is currently not supported by QUEL. This error message will no
**		longer be used once the STAR catalogs are supported.
**	23-aug-95 (emmag)
**		Changed OpenINGRES to OpenIngres.
**	23-apr-1998 (hanch04)
**		Changed OpenIngres to Ingres.

**		Modified the last change to take out the first "%s". The
**		files which use these banners will have to append the
**		product name to them before usage.

/* 
** Explanation:
**	QUEL is not compatible with the current STAR catalogs. STAR is driven

**	CO-tree and converts it into a QP containing SQL queries that are
**	forwarded to the DBMSs (Ingres and others) that actually own the tables
**	involved in the query.  QUEL and SQL have some differences that are not
**	easily smoothed over. 
**
**	This message will be in effect until the STAR catalogs are supported by
**	QUEL.
**
** System Status:
**
** User Action:
**	The user must use SQL to perform queries on a STAR database.

**	04/22/91 (emerson)
**		Added E_OS017C thru E_OS017F for alerter support.
**	05/07/91 (emerson)
**		More modifications for local procedures:
**		Added messages E_OS016D and E_OS016E.
**	09-may-91 (mgw)
**		Added E_OS0132 for syntax error on COPY 'with null' clause.
**		Also corrected typos and moved a commented Explanation back
**		to the error message it describes.
**	06/20/91 (emerson)
**		Added E_OS000A_TypeMismatch (for bug 38203).
**	07/22/91 (emerson)

**	02-aug-1991 (davel)
**		Added E_OS0268_BadTblFld (for bug 35665).
**	08/04/91 (emerson)
**		Provided support for the user to manually issue the osl
**		or oslsql command:  Added E_OS000B thru E_OS000D
**		and changed the wording of E_OS0000 (it can now be
**		a user error).  Also changed the explanatory comments
**		for E_OS0002.
**	08/06/91 (emerson)
**		Added E_OS0269_BadDbmsinfo for bug 21745.
**	08/15/91 (emerson)
**		Added E_OS015A_BadRepeat and E_OS015B_QualRepeat for bug 35468.
**		Also fixed E_OS0159 to reflect the fact that query objects
**		can be arrays or records.
**
**	Revision 6.4/02
**	10/09/91 (emerson)
**		Added comment to the effect that E_OS0257
**		has been superseded by E_OS0260.
**		Refined the E_OS0260 message.
**	12/16/91 (emerson)
**		Integrated a change from the PC group to add a new-line

**		This provides consistency with other OSL compiler completion
**		messages.
**
**	Revision 6.4/03
**	09/20/92 (emerson)
**		Refined the text of E_OS0153 slighty: it said "table field"
**		when it should have said "table field, record, or array".
**		Also reworded the text of E_OS0155 and E_OS0210: target list
**		items can be variables and (for E_OS0210) attributes
**		as well as fields and (for E_OS0210) table field columns.
**		Also changed "attached query" to "query" in several messages.
**		Added E_OS015C_BadColonInSelectTarget (for bugs 38299 and 44004)
**
**	Revision 6.5
**	18-aug-92 (davel)
**		Added E_OS003A (for unterminated delimited identifier).
**	19-may-93 (davel)

**
** User Action:
**	Assign the result of the procedure call to a variable whose type
**	is compatible with all possible procedure names.  Then use
**	the variable instead of the procedure call in the expression.
**	For example:  Suppose the logic of your application ensures
**	that the variable PROCNAME (of type VARCHAR(8)) may contain
**	either 'proc1' or 'proc2'.  Suppose proc1 returns a result
**	of type SMALLINT and proc2 returns a result of type INTEGER.
**	Suppose both proc1 and proc2 take a single integer argument PARM.
**	Suppose i, j, and k are integer variables.
**	Then instead of coding

** User Action:
**	Remove the keyword CALLPROC: code 
**
**		result = system_func(...)

**	instead of
**
**		result = CALLPROC system_func(...)
**
**	Alternatively, if you intended to override the system function

E_OS0269_BadDbmsinfo	"Warning: invalid use of DBMSINFO\n
The system function DBMSINFO is intended for use only inside a DBMS statement
(such as a SELECT).  When used elsewhere, it generally will return the empty
string."

/*%
** Explanation:
**	DBMSINFO is intended for use only inside a DBMS statement.
**
** System Status:
**	The 4GL compilation will continue.
**
** User Action:
**	In general, place the invocation of DBMSINFO inside a SELECT.
**	For example, if v is a VARCHAR variable, code
**
**		SELECT v = DBMSINFO('username');
**
**	instead of
**
**		v = DBMSINFO('username');
**
**	One possible exception is DBMSINFO('_bintim').  Outside a DBMS
**	statement, this has, in prior releases, returned the current time
**	on the machine which is running your application, expressed as
**	the number of seconds elapsed since Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 G.M.T.
**	(This has never been a supported feature).  If you code
**
**		SELECT v = DBMSINFO('_bintim');
**
**	you'll get the current time on the DBMS server machine,
**	which may be different from the current time on the machine
**	which is running your application.  To get the latter time, code
**
**		v = VARCHAR(INT4(INTERVAL('sec', 'now' -

**              Added error E_RW1084_.  In 6.1, adf does not support sum or avg
**                 of a date datatype.  Called from r_p_agg.
**              Changed msg 13E9 to say 'characters wide', not 'columns wide'.
**      29-jun-89 (sylviap)
**		Added -o (output) and -n (number of copies) to all the REPORT
**		   command line flags errors.
**		Created E_RW13EC and E_RW13ED for direct printing.

**		Added E_RW13F0 - for bug 7011.
**      14-aug-89 (sylviap)
**		Added E_RW13F1 for scrollable output help file title.
**	08/16/89 (elein) garnet
**		* Changed wording on 13CB to be more general.  This message
**		can now occur on commands other than printing.
**		* E_RW13F2/4/5 message added for general error of 
**		invalid parameters to commands.
**		* Changed wording on E_RW13F0 to mention that values
**		may be passed on the command line
**		* Added E_RW13F3 for missing argument to right/left
**		margin commands.
**		* Added E_RW13F6 for ending a runtime session due to
**		errors.
**		* Changed title of E_RW13EF because it was too long.
**      28-aug-89 (sylviap)
**		Added E_RW13F7 - for bug 7584 (DG bug).
**      11-sep-89 (sylviap)
**		Added -6 flag to all the syntax error messages.
**      06-oct-89 (sylviap)
**		Fixed E_RW0036_r_nxt_set__Bad_break_ to use %c rather than %s.
**		Was getting 'Internal error' msg.  Added E_RW13F9_Bad_Break
**		to be called rather than E_RW0036.
**      13-oct-89 (sylviap)
**              Added E_RW13FA because RW is no longer supporting the -c flag.
**		Took out the -c in RW's syntax error msgs.
**    10/27/89 (elein)
**            Added E_RW13FB_Bad_Sort_Direction
**	11/1/89 (elein) (jb4642)

**		datatype" message (E_RW1414_).
**	4-nov-1992 (rdrane)
**		Back-out the command line message change to include
**		-ansi92 flag.  There's really no practical reason to
**		have it be command-line enabled.
**	9-dec-1992 (rdrane)
**		Add "Decimal overflow in expr ..." message (E_RW1415_).
**	21-dec-1992 (rdrane)
**		Add r_m_dsort() failure message (E_RW_1416_).
**	2-feb-1993 (rdrane)
**		Correct E_RW1414_.  Used w/ FEmsg(), so needs to have
**		parameters specified in printf() format.
**	17-mar-1993 (rdrane)
**		Clarified msg E_RW112D_ and made it specific to .BLOCK
**		mode.  Added msg E_RW112E_ for the non-.BLOCK mode.
**		These changes address bug 49749.
**	1-jun-1993 (rdrane)
**		Add msg E_RW10A7_No_DelimID.
**	22-jun-1993 (rdrane)
**		Fix-up REPORT command line messages to include new
**		-nofirstff/-firstff flags.
**	7-jul-1993
**		Modify "attribute is unsupported datatype" message (E_RW1414_)
**		to function with IIUGerr() rather than FEmsg().  Remove "or
**		have been pre-deleted" from E_RW1416_, since RBF ChooseColumns
**		prohibits continuing if all column are pre-deleted, and ignores
**		unsupported datatypes.
**	12-jul-1993
**		Modify "attribute is unsupported datatype" messages (E_RW1414_
**		and E_RW1416_) wording so as not to be quite so brusque.
**	21-jul-1993
**		Modify "attribute is unsupported datatype" messages (E_RW1414_
**		and E_RW1416_) so that the line breaks are such that no
**		"extra" wrapping occurs.
**	17-dec-1996 (angusm)
**		Add new message E_RW1417 for use of II_APP_DECIMAL with RW
**		(bug 75576).
**      28-apr-2004 (srisu02)
**             Changes for addition of new flag "numeric_overflow=ignore|fail|warn"
**	25-Jul-2007 (drivi01)
**	       Updated error E_RW1323_ error to provide clearer message 
**	       on Vista.

**		erxtract and are thus in a deliverable.
**	11/07/90 (emerson)
**		Added messages E_TU002F and E_TU0030 (bug 33846).
**	18-jun-1992 (mgw)
**		Added new strings F_TU006E_Synonym, F_TU000A_Base_Table,
**		F_TU0016_Base_Table_Owner and F_TU0046_Destroying_synonym and

**	17-sep-1992 (mgw)
**		Added TU0009_Decimal.
**      12-jan-1993 (rogerl)
**              Correct E_TU0027_Illegal_column_name control so argument is
**              printed.
**	22-jan-1993 (mgw)
**		Added E_TU000E_Own_dot_Tab_notexist for clarity. Same as
**		E_TU0016_Table_doesnt_exist, but says table not owned by '%0c'
**		instead of table not owned by you.
**	16-apr-1993 (rogerl)
**		Add E_TU0010_Must_be_on_table_fiel (50751).
**	21-apr-1993 (rogerl)
**		Add E_TU000E_NotNull_NullDefault, to enable inclusion of row
**		number in error message (there may be multiple, consecutive
**		issuances of this message)
**	23-apr-1993 (rogerl)
**		Change wording & number of E_TU000A_QUEL_Defaults.  It was
**		never released and it is has been superseded, so use it for
**		a similar (but separate) purpose. (now E_TU000A_NA_Defaults)
**	21-may-1993 (rogerl)
**		Add E_TU0012_NADataType to display at BLOB column creat attempt
**	2-aug-1993 (rogerl)
**		Lower case datatype names (53015)
**	27-aug-1993 (mgw) Bug #54557
**		Added error message E_TU000F_Bad_Defaultability for when
**		user enters an illegal defaultability in the Defaults column.
**	20-sep-1993 (mgw)
**		Added new datatypes BYTE, BYTE VARYING, LONG BYTE, and
**		LONG VARCHAR.
**	17-mar-94 (lan)
**		Fixed bug #58066 - Replaced 'INGRES Technical Support'
**		with 'Site Technical Contact'.
**	2-Dec-07 (kibro01) b119562
**		Added extra messages to handle scaling of values in "tables"

"<STRONG>Database Connection Timeout:</STRONG>\n<BR>\n
The database connection timeout value is used to determine when to disconnect\n
a user from a database session. If a user connected to a specified database\n
has not requested any database activity before the timeout value is reached,\n
the user is automatically disconnected and must reconnect before processing\n
continues. Enabling the connection timeout value allows clients to make many\n
requests to the same database without reconnecting first each time. This\n 
increases the processing speed of a user's request. The connection timeout\n
value is used when Ingres/ICE and a Web server are initialized\n
together. A value of \"0\" means\n to disconnect users from their database\n
sessions as soon as their request is complete. This has pretty much the same\n
effect as running Ingres/ICE as a CGI application. The default value\n
is <strong>300 seconds (5 minutes)</strong>\n"

"<STRONG>Database Connection Timeout:</STRONG>\n<BR>\n
The database connection timeout value is used to determine when to disconnect\n
a user from a database session. If a user connected to a specified database\n
has not requested any database activity before the timeout value is reached,\n
the user is automatically disconnected and must reconnect before processing\n
continues. Enabling the connection timeout value allows clients to make many\n
requests to the same database without reconnecting first each time. This\n 
increases the processing speed of a user's request. The connection timeout\n
value is used when Ingres/ICE and a Web server are initialized\n
together. A value of \"0\" means\n to disconnect users from their database\n
sessions as soon as their request is complete. This has pretty much the same\n
effect as running Ingres/ICE as a CGI application. The default value\n
