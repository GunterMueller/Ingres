.SH NAME
byteswap \- Reveal byte ordering differences from VAX architecture.
.SH ORIGIN
Relational Technology, Inc.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B byteswap
[ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Byteswap
shows the underlying byte order of the hardware.  The program prints
nothing if the byte ordering is the same as a VAX.  If the words in an
integer are swapped
.nf

	wordswap
.PP
is printed.  If the bytes are swapped,
.nf

	byteswap
.PP
is printed.  If there is any output, BYTE_SWAP must be set for INGRES.

.B -v
``verbose'' mode prints the program's name and indents the output one
tab stop.  The long value 0x12345678 is printed as a long, as two shorts
and as four chars in increasing byte order.
.SH BUGS
.I Byteswap
will become very confused on non-32 bit systems.
