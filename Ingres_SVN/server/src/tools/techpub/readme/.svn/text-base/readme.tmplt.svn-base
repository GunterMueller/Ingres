<p>Before you start using the software, you should review this
readme file for important information on the installation
and use of the product.  
<p>The information provided here is for use with the following
Ingres guides:
<ul>
<p><li><i>Release Summary</i>
<p><li><i>Quick Start Guide</i>
<p><li><i>Installation Guide</i>

<p>Make sure that copies of this readme are distributed to the
system administrator, database administrator, and
applications developers using Ingres at your site. This
document contains information of interest to each of these
users.

<h2><a name="installation_considerations">3.0  Installation Considerations</a></h2>
<p>Pay particular attention to the information in the

<h3><a name="upgrading_abf_applications">3.1  Upgrading ABF Applications</a></h3>
<p>As part of column collation support added in Ingres r3
3.0.2, and included in this release, the data descriptor
used throughout the Ingres system has changed. This data
descriptor is also compiled into imaged ABF applications.
<p>All ABF applications created using Ingres r3 or earlier
need to be re-imaged after upgrading. This is done by
deleting the contents of the ABF object directory,
$ING_ABFDIR/&lt;database-name&gt;/&lt;app-name&gt;, and re-imaging.
<p>

<h2><a name="general_considerations">4.0  General Considerations</a></h2>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="features_not_included_in_ingres_2006_release_2">4.1  Features Not Included in Ingres 2006 Release 2</a></h3>
<p>Due to some unresolved problems, the following features are
not currently supported in Ingres 2006, but will be
supported in a future release:
<ul>
<p><li>Bridge Server
<p><li>International Language Message File Support
<p><li>Ingres Cluster Solution (Active-Active Only, the Failover
Cluster Solution is supported)
</ul>
<p>The following feature is no longer available in Ingres:
<ul>
<p><li>JDBC Server
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ansi_date_time_data_types">4.2  ANSI Date/Time Data Types</a></h3>
<p>The new date/time data types, while technically compliant
with the ANSI specification, do not have the same rich
functionality as Ingres dates. We are reviewing
enhancements to extend the functionality of the new types
for consistency and compatibility with prior releases and
other database products. We welcome your input in this
process.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="behavioral_changes_from_ingres_release_2_6_and_ingres_2006_to_ingres_2006_release_2">4.3  Behavioral Changes from Ingres Release 2.6 and Ingres 2006 to Ingres 2006 Release 2</a></h3>
<p>Note the following behavioral changes when moving to Ingres
2006 Release 2 from Release 2.6 or 2006.
<p><b>Installer Changes</b>
<p>This release includes a graphical installation wizard on
Linux and Windows. Please reference the correct platform
readme for wizard startup instructions.
<p><b>DAS Server Replaces JDBC Server</b>
<p>The functionality provided in prior releases by the JDBC
Server has been moved to the Data Access Server (DAS). The
DAS provides greater functionality as it also provides
connectivity from .NET Applications to Ingres. The JDBC
Server was deprecated in Ingres r3/2006 and is no longer
distributed with the product. When Ingres 2006 r2 is
installed, the JDBC Server configuration will be
automatically migrated to the DAS Server. If the DAS Server
startup count is currently set to 0, it will set to 1 and
the JDBC Server configuration information will be removed
from the configuration file (config.dat). For more
information on the DAS Server, see the <i>Connectivity Guide</i>. 
<p><b>Ingres Internal Threads on Linux</b>
<p>Internal threads are no longer supported on Linux. The
II_THREAD_TYPE setting will be ignored, and Ingres will
default to Operating System threads.
<p><b>Cache Memory Usage Increased</b>
<p>The DBMS server cache size defaults have been increased in
Ingres 2006. This means that more virtual storage will be
required to run Ingres.
<p><b>Ingres JDBC Driver Cursor Mode</b>
<p>The default cursor mode is now READONLY rather than
allowing the DBMS to determine the mode. The original
behavior can be selected using the URL attribute
CURSOR=DBMS or setting the property
ingres.jdbc.property.cursor_mode=dbms in the driver
property file. 
<p><b>Ingres JDBC Driver Package</b>
<p>The original Ingres JDBC Driver and DataSources classes
contained in the Java archive iijdbc.jar under the Java
package path of "ca.ingres.jdbc" are moved to the package
path of "com.ingres.jdbc". The iijdbc.jar archive included
with Ingres 2006 also contains the original classes for
backward compatibility. The original "ca.ingres.jdbc"
package path and classes will be removed from iijdbc.jar in
the next major release. Existing references to
"ca.ingres.jdbc" classes will continue to work, but should
be changed when convenient. New references should use the
package path of "com.ingres.jdbc". 
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="openroad_support">4.4  OpenROAD<sup>Â®</sup> Support</a></h3>
<p>This version of Ingres supports OpenROAD 2006 running in
the local instance.
<p>This version of Ingres does not support OpenROAD 4.1
running in the local instance. We recommend that OpenROAD
4.1 applications&nbsp;be run through Ingres Net. 
<p>For more information, visit <a href="http://ingres.com/support" target="_blank">http://ingres.com/support</a>  or
contact technical support.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="enterprise_access_support">4.5  Enterprise Access Support</a></h3>
<p>This version of Ingres does not support Enterprise Access
2.1 or 2.6 running in the local instance. For more
information, visit <a href="http://ingres.com/support" target="_blank">http://ingres.com/support</a>  or contact
technical support.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="odbc_support">4.6  ODBC Support</a></h3>
<p>The Ingres ODBC driver can be used with the Ingres ODBC
Call-level interface (CLI) or with a supported third-party
ODBC driver manager. For more information, see the
<i>Connectivity Guide</i>.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="unicode_support_in_terminal_monitor">4.7  Unicode Support in Terminal Monitor</a></h3>
<p>The terminal monitor now supports displaying query results
from Unicode columns by coercing them to local character
set. It will return an error if the Unicode character
cannot be coerced to the local character set.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="selecting_or_updating_new_data_types_from_an_older_client">4.8  Selecting or Updating New Data Types from an Older Client</a></h3>
<p>When connecting from an older version of the client to
Ingres 2006 Release 2, if a query attempts to select or
update a new data type not supported by the client (for
example, ANSI date/time types), you will receive error
E_US10F0.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="web_deployment_option">4.9  Web Deployment Option</a></h3>
<p>The Web Deployment Option is a deprecated feature and will
be removed in a future release of Ingres.
