 This form configures static and dynamically-loaded security mechanisms.  
 To run a dynamically-loaded mechanism such as Kerberos, your local
 installation must already be running the third-party security
 software.  Static security mechanisms such as Ingres or System require
 no additional software.  See the Release Notes for more information.
