The following directory will be used to store Application-By-Forms, Vision
and VisionPro applications:

	/home/ingres/SANDBOX/Ingres_SVN/server/install/build/ingres/abf

This default location can be changed later by redefining the Ingres
variable ING_ABFDIR, using the command: 

	ingsetenv ING_ABFDIR <location>

This variable can also be defined in the Unix environment.


ING_ABFDIR configured as /home/ingres/SANDBOX/Ingres_SVN/server/install/build/ingres/abf

Application-By-Forms setup complete.
