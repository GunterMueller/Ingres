# This script makes an executable file from a FORTRAN source file.
# It is called as an OS/TCL command from the SEP FORTRAN tests.
#
# Usage is:
#	
#	sepfortr <querylanguage> <programname> <libnames...>
#
# where <querylanguage> is either 'sql' or 'quel'
#	<programname> is the root part of a *.sa or *.qa file
#	<libnames...> are a list of libraries for this test (i.e.,
#		the outputs of the "seplib" command, without the ".a"
#		extension.) 
#
# Examples:
#	
#   To make an executable called "thing.exe" from an FORTRAN/QUEL
#   file called "thing.qa": 
#
#	sepfortr quel thing
#
#   To make an executable called "stuff.exe" from and FORTRAN/SQL source
#   file called "stuff.sa" and a library named "myforms.a":
#	
#	sepfortr sql stuff myform
#
# About libraries:
#
#   The library names passed on the 'sepfortr' command line must be portable
#   (i.e., no path names, etc.).  Ideally, the same 'sepfortr' command 
#   should work on any platform (Unix, VMS... even MPE XL!) and in any
#   test environment (PT, OSG, PKS...).
#
#   Use the environment variable SEP_FORTRAN_LD to pass libraries to 'sepfortr'
#   that are not specific to an individual test. Also, use SEP_FORTRAN_LD to 
#   pass names of libraries that are platform dependent. For example,
#
#    setenv SEP_FORTRAN_LD "$II_SYSTEM/ingres/lib/libingres.a -lm /usr/lib/libc.a"
#
#   But DON'T set SEP_FORTRAN_LD from within a SEP script! Always set it 
#   BEFORE you invoke SEP or Listexec!
